## **2. Data Loading and Preprocessing**

### **a. Loading the Dataset**

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/content/fetal_health.csv')  # Update the path as necessary

# Display the first five rows to verify
print("First five rows of the dataset:")
print(data.head())

# Check the shape of the dataset
print(f"\nDataset Shape: {data.shape}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`pd.read_csv()`**: Reads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The path `/content/fetal_health.csv` suggests that this is being run in a Google Colab environment, where `/content/` is the default working directory.

- **`data.head()`**: Displays the first five rows of the DataFrame to provide a quick overview of the data structure, ensuring that the data has been loaded correctly.

- **`data.shape`**: Returns a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame (number of rows, number of columns), giving insight into the dataset's size.

**Purpose:**

This section ensures that the dataset is loaded correctly and provides initial insights into its structure and size, allowing for early detection of any issues with the data loading process.

### **b. Feature Selection: Dropping Less Important Features**

```python
# Features to drop based on prior analysis
features_to_drop = [
    'fetal_movement',
    'histogram_width',
    'histogram_max',
    'mean_value_of_long_term_variability',
    'histogram_number_of_peaks',
    'light_decelerations',
    'histogram_tendency',
    'histogram_number_of_zeroes',
    'severe_decelerations',
    'baseline value',
    'histogram_min'
]

# Drop the specified features
data_dropped = data.drop(columns=features_to_drop)

# Verify the remaining features
print("\nFeatures after dropping less important ones:")
print(data_dropped.columns.tolist())

# Check the new shape of the dataset
print(f"\nNew Dataset Shape after dropping features: {data_dropped.shape}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`features_to_drop`**: A list of feature names identified as less important based on prior analysis (which isn't shown here but presumably involved domain knowledge or exploratory data analysis).

- **`data.drop(columns=features_to_drop)`**: Removes the specified columns from the DataFrame, resulting in `data_dropped`.

- **`data_dropped.columns.tolist()`**: Lists the remaining feature names post-dropping, ensuring that the intended features have been removed.

- **`data_dropped.shape`**: Checks the new dimensions of the DataFrame after feature removal, confirming that columns have been successfully dropped.

**Purpose:**

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** By eliminating less important features, the model focuses on the most relevant data, improving computational efficiency and potentially enhancing predictive performance.

- **Noise Reduction:** Removing irrelevant features reduces noise in the data, minimizing the risk of the model learning spurious patterns.

### **c. Target Variable Preparation**

```python
# Convert 'fetal_health' to integer
data_dropped['fetal_health'] = data_dropped['fetal_health'].astype(int)

# Mapping numerical classes to descriptive labels
health_mapping = {1: 'Normal', 2: 'Suspect', 3: 'Pathological'}
data_dropped['fetal_health_label'] = data_dropped['fetal_health'].map(health_mapping)

# Display the mapping
print("\nDataset with Mapped Labels:")
print(data_dropped[['fetal_health', 'fetal_health_label']].head())
```

**Explanation:**

- **Type Conversion:** Ensures that the target variable `'fetal_health'` is of integer type, which is essential for classification tasks.

- **Class Mapping:**
  - **`health_mapping`**: A dictionary that maps numerical class labels to descriptive categories:
    - **1**: Normal
    - **2**: Suspect
    - **3**: Pathological
  
  - **`data_dropped['fetal_health_label'] = ...`**: Creates a new column `'fetal_health_label'` by mapping the numerical labels to their descriptive counterparts using the `health_mapping` dictionary.

- **Visualization:** Displays the first five entries of the DataFrame, showing both the numerical and descriptive class labels to verify correct mapping.

**Purpose:**

- **Data Clarity:** Adding descriptive labels enhances readability and interpretability, especially when presenting results or creating visualizations.

- **Model Compatibility:** Ensures that the target variable is in the appropriate format for classification algorithms.

### **d. Separating Features and Target**

```python
# Features and target
X = data_dropped.drop(['fetal_health', 'fetal_health_label'], axis=1)
y = data_dropped['fetal_health']
```

**Explanation:**

- **`X` (Features):** All columns except the target variables `'fetal_health'` and `'fetal_health_label'`. This matrix serves as the input features for the model.

- **`y` (Target):** The `'fetal_health'` column, representing the class labels that the model aims to predict.

**Purpose:**

Separating features and target variables is a standard preprocessing step, facilitating independent handling of input data and the prediction target.

---

## **3. Handling Class Imbalance**

### **a. Introduction to Class Imbalance**

In classification tasks, especially in medical diagnoses, datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where some classes (e.g., 'Pathological') have significantly fewer samples than others (e.g., 'Normal'). This imbalance can lead models to become biased toward the majority classes, undermining their ability to correctly predict minority classes.

### **b. Addressing Imbalance with ADASYN and Tomek Links**

```python
# Initialize ADASYN with 'auto' strategy to resample all classes
adasyn = ADASYN(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)

# Apply ADASYN to the dataset
X_adasyn, y_adasyn = adasyn.fit_resample(X, y)

# Initialize Tomek Links
tomek = TomekLinks()

# Apply Tomek Links to clean the dataset
X_resampled, y_resampled = tomek.fit_resample(X_adasyn, y_adasyn)

# Display the shape of the resampled dataset and class distribution
print(f"\nResampled X shape after ADASYN + Tomek Links: {X_resampled.shape}")
print(f"Resampled y distribution after ADASYN + Tomek Links:\n{y_resampled.value_counts()}")

# Visualize the resampled class distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x=y_resampled, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Class Distribution After ADASYN + Tomek Links')
plt.xlabel('Fetal Health')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ADASYN` (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling):**
  - **Purpose:** Generates synthetic samples for minority classes to balance the class distribution.
  - **`sampling_strategy='auto'`**: Balances all classes by generating synthetic data for all minority classes until all classes have the same number of samples as the majority class.
  - **`random_state=42`**: Ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed.
  
- **`fit_resample()`**: Applies the sampling strategy to the feature matrix `X` and target vector `y`, resulting in `X_adasyn` and `y_adasyn`.

- **`TomekLinks`:**
  - **Purpose:** Removes overlapping samples between classes, specifically eliminating Tomek links—pairs of samples from different classes that are each other's nearest neighbors.
  - **Effect:** Cleans the dataset by removing ambiguous or overlapping samples, enhancing class separability.
  
- **`fit_resample()`**: Applies Tomek Links to the ADASYN-resampled data, yielding `X_resampled` and `y_resampled`.

- **Visualization:**
  - **`sns.countplot`**: Plots the class distribution after resampling, providing a visual confirmation of class balance.

**Purpose:**

- **Mitigating Bias:** Balancing classes prevents the model from becoming biased toward majority classes, ensuring it learns to recognize and predict minority classes effectively.

- **Data Cleaning:** Removing Tomek links enhances the quality of the dataset by eliminating noisy or overlapping samples, leading to clearer decision boundaries.

- **Performance Improvement:** Balanced and cleaner datasets often result in models with better generalization capabilities and higher predictive performance across all classes.

**Outcome:**

Post-resampling, the dataset exhibits a balanced class distribution, as confirmed by the printed class counts and the count plot. This setup is conducive to training models that perform well across all classes.

---

## **4. Data Splitting and Scaling**

### **a. Splitting the Resampled Data into Training and Testing Sets**

```python
# Split the resampled data (70% train, 30% test) with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y_resampled
)

# Display the shapes of the training and testing sets
print(f"\nTraining set shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing set shape: {X_test.shape}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`train_test_split()`**: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - **`X_resampled` & `y_resampled`**: The balanced feature matrix and target vector after ADASYN and Tomek Links.
  - **`test_size=0.3`**: Allocates 30% of the data to the testing set and 70% to the training set.
  - **`random_state=42`**: Ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed.
  - **`stratify=y_resampled`**: Maintains the same class distribution in both training and testing sets, preserving balance.

- **Shape Verification:** Prints the dimensions of the training and testing sets to confirm successful splitting.

**Purpose:**

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Separating data into training and testing sets allows the model to learn from one subset and be evaluated on an unseen subset, assessing its generalization performance.

- **Maintaining Class Balance:** Stratification ensures that both subsets retain the balanced class distribution achieved through resampling, preventing skewed evaluations.

### **b. Feature Scaling with MinMaxScaler**

```python
# Initialize the MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Fit the scaler on the training data and transform
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the testing data
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Convert the scaled arrays back to DataFrames for easier handling
X_train_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_train_scaled, columns=X.columns, index=X_train.index)
X_test_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_test_scaled, columns=X.columns, index=X_test.index)

# Verify scaling by checking min and max values
print("\nMin of Scaled Training Features (Should be 0):")
print(X_train_scaled.min())

print("\nMax of Scaled Training Features (Should be 1):")
print(X_train_scaled.max())
```

**Explanation:**

- **`MinMaxScaler`:**
  - **Purpose:** Scales features to a specified range, typically [0, 1], ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.
  
- **`fit_transform()` on Training Data:**
  - **`fit_transform(X_train)`**: Computes the minimum and maximum values for each feature in the training set and scales the data accordingly.
  - **`X_train_scaled`**: The scaled training feature matrix.

- **`transform()` on Testing Data:**
  - **`transform(X_test)`**: Applies the same scaling parameters (min and max) derived from the training data to the testing set, ensuring consistency.

- **DataFrame Conversion:**
  - **Purpose:** Converts the scaled NumPy arrays back into pandas DataFrames with appropriate feature names and indices, facilitating easier data handling and interpretation.

- **Scaling Verification:**
  - **`X_train_scaled.min()` & `X_train_scaled.max()`**: Checks the minimum and maximum values of the scaled features to confirm that scaling was successful, with values ranging from 0 to 1.

**Purpose:**

- **Feature Normalization:** Scaling ensures that features with larger numerical ranges do not dominate those with smaller ranges, promoting uniform learning across features.

- **Model Performance:** Many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models like TabNet, perform better and converge faster when features are scaled.

### **c. Adjusting Target Labels**

```python
# Adjust the target values so they start from 0
y_train = y_train - 1
y_test = y_test - 1

# Display the adjusted target distributions
print("\nAdjusted y_train distribution:")
print(pd.Series(y_train).value_counts())

print("\nAdjusted y_test distribution:")
print(pd.Series(y_test).value_counts())
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label Adjustment:**
  - **`y_train = y_train - 1` & `y_test = y_test - 1`**: Converts target labels from 1, 2, 3 to 0, 1, 2 respectively.
  
- **Distribution Check:**
  - **`pd.Series(y_train).value_counts()` & `pd.Series(y_test).value_counts()`**: Displays the number of samples in each class after adjustment, ensuring class balance and correct label transformation.

**Purpose:**

- **Model Compatibility:** Many machine learning models, including TabNetClassifier, expect class labels to start from 0. Adjusting labels ensures compatibility and prevents potential indexing errors.

- **Consistency:** Maintains consistency across training and testing sets after label adjustment, crucial for accurate model evaluation.

### **d. Splitting Training Data into Training and Validation Sets**

```python
# Further split the training data into training and validation sets (80% train, 20% validation)
X_train_final, X_valid, y_train_final, y_valid = train_test_split(
    X_train_scaled, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_train
)

# Display the shapes of the final training and validation sets
print(f"\nFinal Training set shape: {X_train_final.shape}")
print(f"Validation set shape: {X_valid.shape}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Purpose of Validation Set:**
  - **Model Evaluation During Training:** The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training, enabling early stopping and hyperparameter tuning without peeking into the testing set.
  
- **`train_test_split()` Parameters:**
  - **`X_train_scaled` & `y_train`**: The already scaled and stratified training data.
  - **`test_size=0.2`**: Allocates 20% of the training data to the validation set and 80% to the final training set.
  - **`random_state=42`**: Ensures reproducibility.
  - **`stratify=y_train`**: Maintains class distribution in both training and validation sets.

- **Shape Verification:** Confirms the sizes of the final training and validation sets.

**Purpose:**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection:** Having a separate validation set allows for unbiased evaluation of model configurations during training, essential for selecting the best-performing model.

## **5. Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna**

### **a. Defining the Objective Function for Optuna**

```python
# Define the objective function for Optuna
def objective(trial: Trial):
    # Define the hyperparameter space
    n_d = trial.suggest_int('n_d', 32, 128)
    n_a = trial.suggest_int('n_a', 32, 128)
    n_steps = trial.suggest_int('n_steps', 3, 10)
    gamma = trial.suggest_float('gamma', 1.0, 2.0)
    lambda_sparse = trial.suggest_float('lambda_sparse', 1e-4, 1e-2, log=True)
    learning_rate = trial.suggest_float('learning_rate', 1e-3, 1e-1, log=True)
    batch_size = trial.suggest_categorical('batch_size', [128, 256, 512])

    # Initialize TabNet with current hyperparameters
    tabnet = TabNetClassifier(
        n_d=n_d,
        n_a=n_a,
        n_steps=n_steps,
        gamma=gamma,
        lambda_sparse=lambda_sparse,
        optimizer_fn=torch.optim.Adam,
        optimizer_params=dict(lr=learning_rate),
        mask_type='sparsemax',
        verbose=0
    )

    # Train the model on the final training set
    tabnet.fit(
        X_train=X_train_final.values,
        y_train=y_train_final.values,
        eval_set=[(X_valid.values, y_valid.values)],
        eval_name=['valid'],
        eval_metric=['accuracy'],
        max_epochs=100,
        patience=20,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        virtual_batch_size=128,
        num_workers=0,
        drop_last=False
    )

    # Predict on the validation set
    y_pred = tabnet.predict(X_valid.values)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_valid, y_pred)

    return accuracy
```

**Explanation:**

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - **`predict()`**: Generates predictions on the validation set.
  - **`accuracy_score()`**: Calculates the accuracy of predictions against true labels.

- **Return Value:**
  - **`accuracy`**: The validation accuracy, which Optuna aims to maximize.

**Purpose:**

- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:** Enables systematic and efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space to identify configurations that yield the highest validation accuracy.

- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tuning hyperparameters enhances the model's performance, ensuring it captures the underlying data patterns effectively without overfitting.

### **b. Creating and Optimizing the Optuna Study**

```python
# Create and optimize the Optuna study
study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize', study_name='TabNet Hyperparameter Optimization')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50, timeout=3600)  # Adjust n_trials and timeout as needed

# Display the best hyperparameters and validation accuracy
print("Best Hyperparameters: ", study.best_params)
print("Best Validation Accuracy: ", study.best_value)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`create_study()`**:
  - **`direction='maximize'`**: Instructs Optuna to seek hyperparameter configurations that maximize the objective function, which in this case is validation accuracy.
  
  - **`study_name='TabNet Hyperparameter Optimization'`**: Assigns a name to the study for identification purposes.
  
- **`study.optimize()`**:
  - **`objective`**: The function defined earlier that Optuna will optimize.
  
  - **`n_trials=50`**: Specifies the number of hyperparameter trials Optuna will execute. Each trial represents a unique set of hyperparameters.
  
  - **`timeout=3600`**: Sets a time limit (in seconds) for the optimization process. If the time limit is reached before completing all trials, the study stops.

- **Result Reporting:**
  - **`study.best_params`**: Retrieves the hyperparameter set that achieved the highest validation accuracy.
  
  - **`study.best_value`**: Retrieves the highest validation accuracy achieved during the study.

**Purpose:**

- **Optimal Configuration Identification:** Finds the best combination of hyperparameters that maximize model performance, ensuring that TabNet operates under optimal settings.

- **Efficiency:** Automates the hyperparameter search process, saving time and computational resources compared to manual tuning.

**Outcome:**

After optimization, the best hyperparameters and corresponding validation accuracy are printed, providing a foundation for training the final model with these optimal settings.

## **6. Data Augmentation via Feature Permutation**

### **a. Defining the Data Augmentation Function**

```python
# -------------------
# Part 1: Data Augmentation Function
# -------------------

def augment_data(X, y, permutation_prob=0.1):
    """
    Augment the dataset by randomly permuting feature orders with a given probability.

    Parameters:
    - X (numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame): Feature matrix.
    - y (numpy.ndarray or pandas.Series): Target vector.
    - permutation_prob (float): Probability of permuting each sample.

    Returns:
    - X_augmented (numpy.ndarray): Augmented feature matrix.
    - y_augmented (numpy.ndarray): Augmented target vector.
    """
    X_augmented = []
    y_augmented = []
    for sample, label in zip(X, y):
        if np.random.rand() < permutation_prob:
            perm = np.random.permutation(sample.shape[0])
            sample = sample[perm]
        X_augmented.append(sample)
        y_augmented.append(label)
    return np.array(X_augmented), np.array(y_augmented)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function Purpose:** Introduces a data augmentation strategy by randomly permuting the order of features in a subset of samples. This regularization technique encourages the model to focus on the importance of features rather than their positional order, enhancing robustness.

- **Parameters:**
  - **`X`**: Feature matrix, either as a NumPy array or pandas DataFrame.
  - **`y`**: Target vector, either as a NumPy array or pandas Series.
  - **`permutation_prob`**: The probability (between 0 and 1) that any given sample will have its feature order permuted.

- **Process:**
  - **Iteration:** Goes through each sample and its corresponding label.
  
  - **Permutation Decision:** For each sample, generates a random float between 0 and 1. If this value is less than `permutation_prob`, the sample's feature order is randomly shuffled using `np.random.permutation()`.
  
  - **Appending:** Adds the (potentially permuted) sample and its label to the augmented datasets.

- **Return Values:**
  - **`X_augmented`**: The feature matrix after augmentation, returned as a NumPy array.
  
  - **`y_augmented`**: The corresponding target vector, maintaining the original labels.

**Purpose:**

- **Regularization:** Prevents the model from becoming overly reliant on the order of features, promoting learning based on feature importance. This technique can reduce overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

- **Data Diversity:** Increases the diversity of the training data, providing the model with varied representations that can improve robustness.

**Considerations:**

- **`permutation_prob` Value:** A balance must be struck. Too high a probability may distort the data excessively, while too low may offer insufficient regularization benefits. Optimizing this parameter (as done later) is crucial.

---

## **7. Model Training with Augmented Data**

### **a. Applying Data Augmentation**

```python
# -------------------
# Part 2: Apply Data Augmentation
# -------------------

# Set the permutation probability (e.g., 10% of the training samples will have permuted features)
permutation_probability = 0.1

# Apply the augmentation function to the final training set

    """
    feature_importances = {}
    baseline = metric(y, model.predict(X.values))

    for col in X.columns:
        scores = []
        for _ in range(n_repeats):
            X_permuted = X.copy()
            X_permuted[col] = np.random.permutation(X_permuted[col].values)
            y_pred = model.predict(X_permuted.values)
            score = metric(y, y_pred)
            scores.append(score)

        importance = baseline - np.mean(scores)
        feature_importances[col] = importance

    return feature_importances
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function Purpose:** Quantifies the importance of each feature by measuring the decrease in model performance when that feature's values are randomly shuffled. This method assesses how much the model relies on each feature for accurate predictions.

- **Parameters:**
  - **`model`**: The trained TabNetClassifier instance.
  
  - **`X`**: The feature matrix for which feature importance is being assessed.
  
  - **`y`**: The true labels corresponding to `X`.

      - **`X_permuted[col] = np.random.permutation(X_permuted[col].values)`**: Shuffles the values of the current feature across all samples.
      
      - **Prediction and Scoring:** The model predicts labels on the permuted dataset, and the chosen metric (accuracy) is calculated.
    
    - **Importance Calculation:** 
      - **`importance = baseline - np.mean(scores)`**: The average drop in performance across the repeats is considered the feature's importance. A larger drop indicates higher importance.
      
    - **Recording Importance:** Stores the importance score in a dictionary mapping feature names to their respective scores.

- **Return Value:**
  - **`feature_importances`**: A dictionary where keys are feature names and values are their corresponding importance scores.

**Purpose:**
