## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and interpretable machine learning model for fetal health detection using the Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset. By leveraging **TabNet**, a deep learning model tailored for tabular data, and integrating **Permutation-Based Feature Importance** within its attention mechanisms, this study aims to achieve high classification accuracy while providing meaningful insights into feature contributions. The ultimate goal is to contribute a methodologically sound and interpretable model suitable for publication in a Q1 journal.

## Introduction

Fetal health monitoring is critical for ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the unborn child. Cardiotocography (CTG) is a widely used method for assessing fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during pregnancy. Accurate classification of fetal health status can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, potentially reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes.

While traditional machine learning models have been employed for CTG analysis, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand feature contributions to predictions. **TabNet**, an advanced deep learning model, offers both high performance and inherent interpretability through its attention mechanisms. By integrating **Permutation-Based Feature Importance**, we enhance TabNet's ability to quantify the significance of each feature, thereby providing deeper insights into the model's decision-making process.

This documentation outlines the complete workflow, from data preprocessing to model training, hyperparameter optimization, and feature importance analysis, culminating in a comprehensive fetal health detection system.

---

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step that involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for model training. This section details each sub-step involved in preparing the CTG dataset for fetal health detection.

### Loading the Dataset

We begin by loading the CTG dataset, which contains various features related to fetal heart rate and uterine contractions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/content/fetal_health.csv')  # Update the path as necessary

# Display the first five rows to verify
print("First five rows of the dataset:")
print(data.head())

# Check the shape of the dataset
print(f"\nDataset Shape: {data.shape}")
```

**Purpose:**
- **`pd.read_csv`**: Reads the CSV file containing the CTG data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **`data.head()`**: Displays the first five rows to verify successful loading.
- **`data.shape`**: Provides the dimensions of the dataset, ensuring it has been loaded correctly.

**Contribution to Q1 Journal:**
- Ensures data integrity and provides an initial understanding of the dataset's structure and contents.

### Feature Selection

Feature selection involves identifying and retaining the most relevant features for model training while discarding those that may introduce noise or redundancy.

```python
# Features to drop based on prior analysis
features_to_drop = [
    'fetal_movement',
    'histogram_width',
    'histogram_max',
    'mean_value_of_long_term_variability',
    'histogram_number_of_peaks',
    'light_decelerations',
    'histogram_tendency',
    'histogram_number_of_zeroes',
    'severe_decelerations',
    'baseline value',
    'histogram_min'
]

# Drop the specified features
data_dropped = data.drop(columns=features_to_drop)

# Verify the remaining features
print("\nFeatures after dropping less important ones:")
print(data_dropped.columns.tolist())

# Check the new shape of the dataset
print(f"\nNew Dataset Shape after dropping features: {data_dropped.shape}")
```

**Purpose:**
- **`features_to_drop`**: A list of features identified as less important or redundant based on prior analysis.
- **`data.drop`**: Removes the specified columns from the dataset.
- **`data_dropped.columns.tolist()`**: Displays the remaining features post-dropping.
- **`data_dropped.shape`**: Verifies the reduction in dimensionality.

**Contribution to Q1 Journal:**
- Enhances model efficiency by reducing dimensionality.
- Minimizes overfitting by eliminating irrelevant or noisy features.
- Improves interpretability by focusing on the most impactful features.

### Handling Imbalanced Data

Class imbalance can significantly skew model performance, leading to biased predictions favoring the majority class. To address this, we employ a combination of **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and **Tomek Links** to balance the dataset.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.under_sampling import TomekLinks

# Features and target
X = data_dropped.drop(['fetal_health', 'fetal_health_label'], axis=1)
y = data_dropped['fetal_health']

# Initialize SMOTE with 'auto' strategy to resample all classes
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE to the dataset
X_smote, y_smote = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Initialize Tomek Links
tomek = TomekLinks()

# Apply Tomek Links to clean the dataset
X_resampled, y_resampled = tomek.fit_resample(X_smote, y_smote)

# Display the shape of the resampled dataset and class distribution
print(f"\nResampled X shape after SMOTE + Tomek Links: {X_resampled.shape}")
print(f"Resampled y distribution after SMOTE + Tomek Links:\n{y_resampled.value_counts()}")
```

**Purpose:**
- **`SMOTE`**: Generates synthetic samples for minority classes to balance the class distribution.
- **`TomekLinks`**: Removes overlapping samples between classes to clean the dataset.
- **`fit_resample`**: Applies the sampling techniques to the data.

**Contribution to Q1 Journal:**
- Ensures that the model learns equally from all classes, enhancing its ability to generalize across different fetal health statuses.
- Reduces the risk of bias towards majority classes, improving prediction fairness and reliability.

### Data Splitting and Scaling

Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets is essential for evaluating model performance and preventing overfitting. Additionally, feature scaling standardizes the range of feature values, facilitating more efficient model training.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Split the resampled data (70% train, 30% test) with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y_resampled
)

# Display the shapes of the training and testing sets
print(f"\nTraining set shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing set shape: {X_test.shape}")

# Initialize the MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Fit the scaler on the training data and transform
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the testing data
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Convert the scaled arrays back to DataFrames for easier handling
X_train_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_train_scaled, columns=X.columns, index=X_train.index)
X_test_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_test_scaled, columns=X.columns, index=X_test.index)

# Verify scaling by checking min and max values
print("\nMin of Scaled Training Features (Should be 0):")
print(X_train_scaled.min())

print("\nMax of Scaled Training Features (Should be 1):")
print(X_train_scaled.max())

# Adjust the target values so they start from 0
y_train = y_train - 1
y_test = y_test - 1

# Display the adjusted target distributions
print("\nAdjusted y_train distribution:")
print(pd.Series(y_train).value_counts())

print("\nAdjusted y_test distribution:")
print(pd.Series(y_test).value_counts())

# Further split the training data into training and validation sets
X_train_final, X_valid, y_train_final, y_valid = train_test_split(
    X_train_scaled, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_train
)

# Display the shapes of the final training and validation sets
print(f"\nFinal Training set shape: {X_train_final.shape}")
print(f"Validation set shape: {X_valid.shape}")
```

**Purpose:**
- **`train_test_split`**: Divides the dataset into training and testing subsets while maintaining class distribution through stratification.
- **`MinMaxScaler`**: Scales features to a range between 0 and 1, ensuring uniformity across feature scales.
- **`y_train - 1`**: Adjusts target labels to start from 0, which is a common requirement for certain models.
- **`X_train_final` & `X_valid`**: Further split the training data into training and validation sets to monitor model performance during training.

**Contribution to Q1 Journal:**
- Enhances model robustness by providing distinct datasets for training, validation, and testing.
- Ensures that feature scaling facilitates efficient and effective model learning.
- Maintains class balance across all data splits, contributing to reliable and unbiased model evaluations.

## Model Definition

A critical component of this project is the **PermutationImportanceTabNet** class, an extension of TabNetClassifier. This custom class integrates permutation-based feature importance directly within the model's training process, allowing for dynamic assessment of feature contributions during training.

### PermutationImportanceTabNet Class

```python
from pytorch_tabnet.tab_model import TabNetClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import torch.nn as nn
import torch

class PermutationImportanceTabNet(TabNetClassifier):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, feature_names, permutation_prob=0.1, importance_decay=0.99, *args, **kwargs):
        """

        Returns:
        - out (torch.Tensor): Model outputs.
        - M_loss (float): Mask loss.
        """
        # Original forward pass
        out, M_loss = super(PermutationImportanceTabNet, self).forward(X, y)

        # Apply permutation with a certain probability
        if torch.rand(1).item() < self.permutation_prob:
            # Iterate over each feature to assess its importance
            for i in range(X.size(1)):
                # Clone the input to avoid in-place modifications
                X_permuted = X.clone()

                # Permute the values of the i-th feature across the batch
                X_permuted[:, i] = X_permuted[torch.randperm(X_permuted.size(0)), i]

                # Forward pass with permuted feature
                out_permuted, _ = super(PermutationImportanceTabNet, self).forward(X_permuted, y)

                # Compute predictions
                preds = out.argmax(dim=1)
                preds_permuted = out_permuted.argmax(dim=1)

                # Calculate accuracy
                acc = accuracy_score(y.cpu().numpy(), preds.cpu().numpy())
                acc_perm = accuracy_score(y.cpu().numpy(), preds_permuted.cpu().numpy())

                # Drop in accuracy signifies feature importance
                drop = acc - acc_perm

                # Update importance scores with decay
                self.importance_scores[i] = self.importance_decay * self.importance_scores[i] + (1 - self.importance_decay) * drop

            # Normalize importance scores to sum to 1 for interpretability
            if self.importance_scores.sum() != 0:
                self.importance_scores = self.importance_scores / self.importance_scores.sum()

            # Print feature importance scores
            print("\nFeature Importance Scores after Permutation:")
            for idx, score in enumerate(self.importance_scores):
                feature_name = self.feature_names[idx]
                print(f"{feature_name}: {score.item():.4f}")

        return out, M_loss
```

**Purpose and Functionality:**

1. **Class Initialization (`__init__`):**
   - **`input_dim`**: Specifies the number of input features, crucial for initializing the importance scores tensor.
   - **`feature_names`**: A list containing the names of the features, enabling meaningful interpretation of importance scores.
   - **`permutation_prob`**: Determines the probability of applying feature permutation during each forward pass. A higher value increases the frequency of importance assessments.
   - **`importance_decay`**: Controls the rate at which past importance scores are decayed, smoothing the importance scores over epochs.
   - **`importance_scores`**: A tensor initialized to zero, storing the cumulative importance scores for each feature.

2. **Overriding the Forward Pass (`forward`):**
   - **Standard Forward Pass**: Computes the model's output and mask loss as per TabNet's architecture.
   - **Permutation Logic**:
     - With a probability defined by `permutation_prob`, the model iterates over each feature.
     - For each feature, it creates a permuted version by shuffling its values across the batch.
     - The model then performs a forward pass with the permuted feature and calculates the drop in accuracy compared to the original predictions.
     - This drop quantifies the feature's importance; a larger drop indicates higher importance.
     - Importance scores are updated using an exponential moving average controlled by `importance_decay`.
   - **Normalization**: Ensures that the sum of importance scores equals 1, facilitating easier interpretation.
   - **Output**: Returns the model's output and mask loss, maintaining compatibility with TabNet's training loop.

**Contribution to Q1 Journal:**
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: By integrating permutation-based feature importance within TabNet, the model not only provides accurate predictions but also quantifies the significance of each feature, offering valuable insights.
- **Robustness**: The use of importance decay smoothens the importance scores over time, mitigating the impact of noise and ensuring stable feature importance assessments.
- **Innovation**: Combining TabNet's attention mechanisms with permutation-based importance introduces a novel approach to feature interpretability in deep learning models for tabular data.

Optimizing hyperparameters is essential for enhancing model performance. **Optuna**, a hyperparameter optimization framework, is employed to identify the best combination of hyperparameters for the TabNet model.

```python
import optuna
from optuna import Trial

# Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna
def objective(trial: Trial):
    # Define the hyperparameter space
    n_d = trial.suggest_int('n_d', 32, 128)
    n_a = trial.suggest_int('n_a', 32, 128)

## Model Training and Evaluation

With the best hyperparameters identified, the **PermutationImportanceTabNet** model is instantiated and trained. Post-training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and feature importance scores are extracted.

```python
# Extract best hyperparameters
best_params = study.best_params

feature_names = X.columns.tolist()

# Determine the input dimension from the training data
input_dim = X_train_final.shape[1]

# Initialize the Permutation Importance TabNet with the correct input_dim and feature_names
perm_importance_tabnet = PermutationImportanceTabNet(
    input_dim=input_dim,
    feature_names=feature_names,
    n_d=best_params['n_d'],
    n_a=best_params['n_a'],
    n_steps=best_params['n_steps'],
    gamma=best_params['gamma'],
    lambda_sparse=best_params['lambda_sparse'],
    optimizer_fn=torch.optim.Adam,

    max_epochs=100,
    patience=20,
    batch_size=best_params['batch_size'],
    virtual_batch_size=128
)

# Predict and evaluate on the test set
y_pred_perm_importance = perm_importance_tabnet.predict(X_test_scaled.values)
print("\nPermutation Importance TabNet Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_perm_importance, target_names=['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological']))

# Access and print feature importance scores
print("\nFeature Importance Scores:")

## Feature Importance Analysis

Understanding feature importance is pivotal for interpreting model decisions, especially in critical applications like healthcare. The **PermutationImportanceTabNet** class facilitates this by dynamically assessing feature contributions during training. Additionally, external permutation-based feature importance and **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) are employed for a more comprehensive analysis.

### Internal Permutation-Based Feature Importance

The `PermutationImportanceTabNet` class, as defined earlier, prints feature importance scores after applying permutations during training. These scores indicate how much each feature affects the model's accuracy when its values are shuffled.

```plaintext
Feature Importance Scores after Permutation:
accelerations: 0.1234
uterine_contractions: 0.0987
...
```

**Purpose:**
- **Dynamic Assessment**: Continuously evaluates feature importance throughout training, providing real-time insights.
- **Decay Mechanism**: The `importance_decay` parameter ensures that importance scores are smoothed over epochs, mitigating the impact of noise.

### External Permutation-Based Feature Importance

As an alternative or complement to internal feature importance, external permutation-based feature importance is implemented post-training. This method systematically permutes each feature in the test set and observes the impact on model performance.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'perm_importance_tabnet' is your trained PermutationImportanceTabNet model
# and 'X_test_scaled', 'y_test' are your test datasets

def permutation_feature_importance(model, X, y, metric=accuracy_score, n_repeats=5):
    """
    Compute permutation feature importance for a trained model.

    Parameters:
    - model: Trained PermutationImportanceTabNet model.
    - X: Test features (pandas DataFrame).
    - y: Test labels.
    - metric: Performance metric to evaluate (default: accuracy_score).
    - n_repeats: Number of times to permute a feature.

    Returns:
    - feature_importances: Dictionary mapping feature names to importance scores.
    """
    feature_importances = {}
    baseline = metric(y, model.predict(X.values))
    
    for col in X.columns:
        scores = []
        for _ in range(n_repeats):
            X_permuted = X.copy()
            X_permuted[col] = np.random.permutation(X_permuted[col].values)
            y_pred = model.predict(X_permuted.values)
            score = metric(y, y_pred)
            scores.append(score)
        # Importance is the drop in performance
        importance = baseline - np.mean(scores)
        feature_importances[col] = importance
    
    return feature_importances

# Compute permutation feature importance
feature_importances = permutation_feature_importance(
    model=perm_importance_tabnet,
    X=X_test_scaled,
    y=y_test,
    metric=accuracy_score,
    n_repeats=5
)

# Convert to DataFrame for visualization
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': list(feature_importances.keys()),
    'Importance': list(feature_importances.values())
}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

# Display feature importances
print("\nPermutation Feature Importance:")
print(importance_df)

# Plotting Feature Importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=importance_df, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Permutation Feature Importance (External)')
plt.xlabel('Decrease in Accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Feature')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Purpose:**
- **Systematic Evaluation**: Independently assesses each feature's impact on model performance.
- **Repeatability**: Repeats permutation multiple times (`n_repeats`) to account for variability and ensure reliable importance scores.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar plots for an intuitive understanding of feature significance.

**Contribution to Q1 Journal:**
- **Robust Analysis**: Provides a thorough and repeatable method for quantifying feature importance.
- **Complementary Insights**: Enhances interpretability by corroborating internal permutation-based scores with external evaluations.

### SHAP for Comprehensive Feature Importance

**SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed to provide both global and local interpretability, offering deeper insights into feature contributions across different instances.

```python
import shap

# Initialize SHAP
shap.initjs()

# Define prediction function for SHAP
def tabnet_predict_proba(X):
    return perm_importance_tabnet.predict_proba(X)

# Select a background dataset for SHAP (sample of training data)
background_size = 100
background = X_train_final.sample(n=background_size, random_state=42).values

# Initialize KernelExplainer
explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(tabnet_predict_proba, background)
