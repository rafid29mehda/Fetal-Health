Including a comparison in Part 1 of the study is an excellent way to strengthen the paper and demonstrate why specific decisions, like using LightGBM, are justified. Here are some ideas for meaningful comparisons that could enhance the paper's quality and contribute to its eligibility for a Q1 journal:

---

### **1. Comparison Between Models for Feature Importance**
Since feature importance is central to Part 1, you can compare how different models rank and interpret feature contributions.

#### **Approach**
- Compare **Random Forest** and **LightGBM** in terms of:
  - **Feature Importance Rankings**: Use both models to compute feature importances and rank the top features.
  - **Consistency with SHAP Analysis**: Check if the features ranked high by SHAP align with the model-derived feature importances.
  - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate how well these models perform (e.g., AUC-ROC, F1-score) before and after dropping features based on their rankings.

#### **Rationale**
- Random Forest and LightGBM are widely used ensemble models, but their internal workings differ (e.g., RF uses bagging; LightGBM uses gradient boosting).
- Highlight how LightGBM's histogram-based approach to gradient boosting performs better for histograms and tabular data.

---

### **2. SHAP vs. Traditional Feature Importance**
SHAP is an advanced interpretability tool, but traditional feature importance metrics (e.g., Gini importance) are still commonly used. Compare:
- **SHAP Feature Importance** vs. **Model-Derived Feature Importance** (from Random Forest or LightGBM).
- Evaluate the predictive power of the model trained on features selected by each method:
  - Features selected using SHAP values.
  - Features selected using traditional importance scores.

#### **Rationale**
This comparison demonstrates the added value of using SHAP for feature selection and its potential to improve model interpretability and performance.

---

### **3. Evaluation of Performance Before and After Feature Dropping**
Conduct an experiment showing the impact of dropping features identified as "less important" through SHAP analysis on the model's performance:
1. Train LightGBM and Random Forest on the full dataset.
2. Retrain both models after dropping features identified as less important by SHAP.
3. Compare performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) before and after feature dropping.

#### **Rationale**
This comparison illustrates how SHAP analysis optimizes feature selection and improves performance.

---

### **4. Comparison of Model Behavior Across Classes**
- Compare how Random Forest and LightGBM perform across the three target classes (Normal, Suspect, Pathological).
- Evaluate metrics such as:
  - **Class-Specific F1-Scores**: Which model performs better for minority classes (e.g., Pathological)?
  - **Confusion Matrices**: Analyze where each model struggles with misclassification.
- Use SHAP to compare how features impact predictions for each class in both models.

#### **Rationale**
This showcases LightGBM's ability to handle imbalanced data and its interpretability advantage with SHAP.

---

### **5. Computational Efficiency**
Compare the computational efficiency of Random Forest and LightGBM:
- **Training Time**: Measure the time taken to train both models on the same dataset.
- **Prediction Time**: Evaluate the time taken for batch predictions.
- Highlight LightGBM's efficiency for large datasets due to its histogram-based approach.

#### **Rationale**
Efficiency is critical in real-world applications and is a strong argument for using LightGBM.

---

### **6. Feature Correlation and Stability**
Compare how stable the feature importances are between Random Forest and LightGBM when:
- **Subsampling the Dataset**: Train both models on random subsets of the data and measure the variance in feature importance rankings.
- **Perturbing Input Features**: Add noise to the input features and observe changes in feature importances.

#### **Rationale**
This analysis highlights LightGBM's robustness and stability in feature interpretation.

---

### **7. Impact of Histogram Features**
Since histogram features are prominent in your dataset, specifically evaluate:
1. How much performance improves (or deteriorates) when histogram features are included vs. excluded.
2. Compare Random Forest and LightGBM performance with and without histogram features.

#### **Rationale**
This emphasizes LightGBM's suitability for datasets with histogram features.

---

### **Suggestions for Enhancing the Comparison**
- **Visualization**: Use bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps to visualize differences in feature importance, performance metrics, and computational efficiency.
- **Statistical Tests**: Use paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests to validate significant differences in performance metrics between models.
- **Real-World Justification**: Highlight how your findings align with real-world scenarios or clinical settings.

---

### **Conclusion**
A comparison between Random Forest and LightGBM in terms of feature importance, interpretability, performance metrics, and computational efficiency would provide robust evidence supporting your choice of LightGBM. Integrating these analyses into your paper will demonstrate scientific rigor and strengthen your argument for its use in fetal health detection.
