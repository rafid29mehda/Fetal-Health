Step-by-step process to evaluate the dataset's features using Explainable AI (XAI). We'll proceed in stages, ensuring that each step is clear and manageable. At each stage, I'll provide the necessary code snippets and instructions. If any step requires your input or the output of the previous step, I'll indicate that accordingly.

---

## **Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries and Load the Dataset**

### **a. Import Libraries**

First, we'll import all the essential libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, modeling, and explainability.

```python
# Data manipulation and analysis
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Preprocessing and modeling
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Handling imbalanced data
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Explainable AI
import shap

# Suppress warnings for cleaner output
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

### **b. Load the Dataset**

Assuming your dataset is in a CSV file named `fetal_health.csv`. Please replace `'fetal_health.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset if it's different.

```python
# Replace 'fetal_health.csv' with your actual file path if different
data = pd.read_csv('fetal_health.csv')

# Display the first five rows to verify
print("First five rows of the dataset:")
print(data.head())
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using `pip`. For example:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn shap
     ```
   - Place your dataset (`fetal_health.csv`) in the working directory or provide the correct path to it.
   - Execute the code to load and view the first few rows of the dataset.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - After running the code, please share the output of the `print(data.head())` command. This will help verify that the data has been loaded correctly and understand its initial structure.

---

## **Step 2: Explore the Dataset**

Once you've loaded the data, let's perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.

### **a. Check Data Dimensions and Types**

```python
# Check the shape of the dataset
print(f"Dataset Shape: {data.shape}")

# Check the data types of each column
print("\nData Types:")
print(data.dtypes)
```

### **b. Summary Statistics**

```python
# Display summary statistics
print("\nSummary Statistics:")
print(data.describe())
```

### **c. Check for Missing Values**

```python
# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing Values in Each Column:")
print(data.isnull().sum())
```

### **d. Visualize the Target Variable Distribution**

```python
# Plot the distribution of the target variable
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='fetal_health', data=data, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Distribution of Fetal Health Status')
plt.xlabel('Fetal Health')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code snippets provided to explore the dataset's dimensions, data types, summary statistics, missing values, and the distribution of the target variable.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the outputs of each `print` statement.
   - After executing the visualization code, ensure that the plot is displayed correctly. If you're using an environment like Jupyter Notebook, the plot should appear inline.

**Note:** This step helps in understanding the data's structure, identifying any anomalies, and confirming the absence of missing values.

---

## **Step 3: Preprocess the Data**

Now, we'll preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.

### **a. Handle the Target Variable**

The target variable `fetal_health` is currently of type float. We'll convert it to integer and then to a categorical type for clarity.

```python
# Convert 'fetal_health' to integer
data['fetal_health'] = data['fetal_health'].astype(int)

# Verify the conversion
print("\nData Types After Conversion:")
print(data.dtypes)
```

### **b. Encode the Target Variable (Optional)**

If you prefer, you can map the numerical classes to more descriptive labels.

```python
# Mapping numerical classes to descriptive labels
health_mapping = {1: 'Normal', 2: 'Suspect', 3: 'Pathological'}
data['fetal_health_label'] = data['fetal_health'].map(health_mapping)

# Display the updated DataFrame
print("\nDataset with Mapped Labels:")
print(data[['fetal_health', 'fetal_health_label']].head())
```

### **c. Separate Features and Target**

```python
# Features (all columns except 'fetal_health' and 'fetal_health_label')
X = data.drop(['fetal_health', 'fetal_health_label'], axis=1)

# Target variable
y = data['fetal_health']
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to convert the target variable to an integer type and optionally map it to descriptive labels.
   - Separate the features (`X`) and the target (`y`) for modeling.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the output of the `print` statements to confirm the successful conversion and mapping.
   - Verify that the features and target have been correctly separated by checking the shapes or previewing the `X` and `y` variables if desired.

---

## **Step 4: Handle Class Imbalance**

Your dataset is imbalanced, which can affect model performance. We'll use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes.

### **a. Visualize Class Distribution Before Resampling**

```python
# Visualize the original class distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x=y, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Original Class Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Fetal Health')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### **b. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**

We'll split the data before applying SMOTE to avoid data leakage.

```python
# Split the data (80% train, 20% test) with stratification
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Display the shapes of the splits
print(f"\nTraining Set Shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing Set Shape: {X_test.shape}")
```

### **c. Apply SMOTE to the Training Data**

```python
# Initialize SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE to the training data
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Verify the new class distribution
print("\nClass Distribution After SMOTE:")
print(y_train_resampled.value_counts())
```

### **d. Visualize Class Distribution After Resampling**

```python
# Visualize the resampled class distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x=y_train_resampled, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Class Distribution After SMOTE')
plt.xlabel('Fetal Health')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to visualize the original class distribution, split the data, apply SMOTE to balance the classes, and visualize the new distribution.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the plots showing the class distributions before and after SMOTE.
   - Confirm the shapes of the training and testing sets.
   - Share the class counts after resampling to ensure that SMOTE has balanced the classes effectively.

**Note:** SMOTE is applied only to the training data to prevent information from the test set influencing the model during training.

---

## **Step 5: Feature Scaling**

Scaling features ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

```python
# Initialize the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the scaler on the resampled training data and transform
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train_resampled)

# Transform the test data
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Convert the scaled arrays back to DataFrames for easier handling
X_train_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_train_scaled, columns=X.columns, index=X_train_resampled.index)
X_test_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_test_scaled, columns=X.columns, index=X_test.index)
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to scale the features in both the training and testing sets.

2. **Provide the Output (Optional):**
   - If you'd like, you can verify the scaling by checking the mean and standard deviation of the scaled features.

```python
# Verify scaling by checking means and standard deviations
print("\nMean of Scaled Training Features (Should be ~0):")
print(X_train_scaled.mean())

print("\nStandard Deviation of Scaled Training Features (Should be ~1):")
print(X_train_scaled.std())
```

---

## **Step 6: Train a Random Forest Classifier**

We'll use a Random Forest model due to its robustness and compatibility with XAI techniques like SHAP.

```python
# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model on the resampled and scaled training data
rf_classifier.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train_resampled)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test_scaled)
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to train the Random Forest model and make predictions on the test set.

2. **Proceed to Model Evaluation:**
   - We'll evaluate the model's performance in the next step.

---

## **Step 7: Evaluate the Model**

Assess the performance of your trained model using appropriate metrics.

```python
# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)

# Classification Report
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological'])
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(class_report)

# Visualize the Confusion Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues',
            xticklabels=['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological'],
            yticklabels=['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.show()
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to generate and visualize the confusion matrix and classification report.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the confusion matrix and classification report.
   - Confirm that the visualization of the confusion matrix is correctly displayed.

**Note:** Given the class imbalance was handled using SMOTE, the model should perform better across all classes. However, always consider the context and importance of each class in your application.

---

## **Step 8: Feature Importance Using Random Forest**

Understanding which features contribute most to the model's decisions is crucial. We'll start by extracting feature importances directly from the Random Forest model.

```python
# Extract feature importances
importances = rf_classifier.feature_importances_

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
feature_importances = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X.columns,
    'Importance': importances
}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

# Display the top 10 features
print("\nTop 10 Feature Importances:")
print(feature_importances.head(10))

# Visualize Feature Importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=feature_importances.head(10), palette='viridis')
plt.title('Top 10 Feature Importances from Random Forest')
plt.xlabel('Importance Score')
plt.ylabel('Features')
plt.show()
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to extract and visualize the top 10 most important features according to the Random Forest model.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the printed top 10 feature importances.
   - Ensure that the bar plot is displayed correctly, showing which features are most influential.

**Note:** While feature importances from tree-based models provide a good starting point, more advanced techniques like SHAP can offer deeper insights.

---

## **Step 9: Explainable AI with SHAP**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides a unified approach to interpret the predictions of machine learning models. We'll use SHAP to understand the impact of each feature on the model's predictions.

### **a. Initialize SHAP Explainer**

```python
# Initialize the SHAP TreeExplainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(rf_classifier)

# Calculate SHAP values for the test set
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test_scaled)
```

### **b. Summary Plot**

A summary plot shows the distribution of SHAP values for each feature, indicating their overall impact on the model's output.

```python
# Plot SHAP summary for each class
for i, class_name in enumerate(['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological']):
    print(f"\nSHAP Summary Plot for class: {class_name}")
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values[i], X_test_scaled, feature_names=X.columns, show=False)
    plt.title(f'SHAP Summary Plot for {class_name}')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

### **c. Feature Importance (SHAP) Bar Plot**

This plot shows the mean absolute SHAP value for each feature, providing another view of feature importance.

```python
# SHAP summary bar plot for the 'Pathological' class (class index 2)
class_index = 2  # Assuming 'Pathological' is the third class

print(f"\nSHAP Summary Bar Plot for class: Pathological")
shap.summary_plot(shap_values[class_index], X_test_scaled, plot_type="bar",
                  feature_names=X.columns, show=False)
plt.title('SHAP Feature Importance Bar Plot for Pathological Class')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### **d. Dependence Plot**

A dependence plot shows the relationship between a feature and the SHAP value, highlighting how the feature affects the prediction.

```python
# Replace 'feature_name' with the actual feature you want to analyze
# For demonstration, we'll use the top feature from feature_importances
top_feature = feature_importances['Feature'].iloc[0]
print(f"\nSHAP Dependence Plot for feature: {top_feature}")
shap.dependence_plot(top_feature, shap_values[class_index], X_test_scaled,
                     feature_names=X.columns, show=False)
plt.title(f'SHAP Dependence Plot for {top_feature}')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### **e. Force Plot for an Individual Prediction**

A force plot visualizes the SHAP values for a single prediction, showing how each feature contributes to pushing the prediction from the base value.

```python
# Select an instance to explain (e.g., the first instance in the test set)
instance_index = 0
instance = X_test_scaled.iloc[instance_index]

# Generate SHAP values for the instance
instance_shap_values = [sv[instance_index] for sv in shap_values]

# Create a force plot for the 'Pathological' class
print(f"\nSHAP Force Plot for instance index: {instance_index} (Pathological Class)")
shap.initjs()
shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[class_index], instance_shap_values[class_index],
               instance, feature_names=X.columns, matplotlib=True)
plt.show()
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to generate SHAP plots.
   - Ensure that your environment supports SHAP visualizations. If you're using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, the plots should render inline. For other environments, you might need to adjust settings.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the SHAP summary plots, bar plots, dependence plots, and force plots.
   - Specifically, ensure that the force plot is rendered correctly. In some environments, you might need to adjust how SHAP plots are displayed.

**Note:** SHAP can be resource-intensive for large datasets. Given your dataset size (2,126 rows), it should work smoothly, but ensure that your environment has sufficient resources.

---

## **Step 10: Permutation Feature Importance (Optional)**

Permutation importance assesses the decrease in model performance when a feature's values are randomly shuffled, providing insights into feature importance.

```python
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

# Compute permutation importance on the test set
perm_importance = permutation_importance(rf_classifier, X_test_scaled, y_test,
                                         n_repeats=30, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
perm_importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X.columns,
    'Importance': perm_importance.importances_mean,
    'Std': perm_importance.importances_std
}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

# Display the top 10 permutation importances
print("\nTop 10 Permutation Feature Importances:")
print(perm_importance_df.head(10))

# Visualize Permutation Importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=perm_importance_df.head(10), palette='viridis')
plt.title('Top 10 Permutation Feature Importances')
plt.xlabel('Mean Importance')
plt.ylabel('Features')
plt.show()
```

### **Instructions:**

1. **Run the Above Code:**
   - Execute the code to calculate and visualize permutation feature importances.

2. **Provide the Output:**
   - Share the printed top 10 permutation feature importances.
   - Ensure that the bar plot is displayed correctly.

**Note:** Permutation importance can be computationally intensive, especially with a high number of repeats. Adjust `n_repeats` if necessary based on your system's performance.

---

## **Step 11: Interpret the Results**

After executing the above steps, you'll have multiple insights into which features are most influential in predicting fetal health. Here's how to interpret them:

1. **Random Forest Feature Importances:**
   - Shows which features the model considers most important based on how much they improve the split criteria.

2. **SHAP Summary Plots:**
   - Provides a detailed view of feature impacts across all predictions.
   - Positive SHAP values indicate a feature pushing the prediction towards a higher class (e.g., Pathological), while negative values push towards a lower class (e.g., Normal).

3. **SHAP Dependence Plots:**
   - Illustrates how a feature's value affects its SHAP value, revealing potential interactions with other features.

4. **Permutation Feature Importances:**
   - Validates feature importance by measuring the drop in model performance when a feature is randomly shuffled.

### **Recommendations:**

- **Focus on Top Features:**
  - Investigate the top features identified by both Random Forest and SHAP. Understand their clinical relevance to fetal health.

- **Feature Redundancy:**
  - If certain features are consistently low in importance across different methods, consider removing them to simplify the model.

- **Model Validation:**
  - Ensure that the model's performance metrics (from the classification report) are satisfactory for your use case, especially given the medical implications.

- **Collaboration with Domain Experts:**
  - Collaborate with medical professionals to validate whether the important features align with clinical knowledge.
