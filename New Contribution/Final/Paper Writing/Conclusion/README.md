## Conclusion

This study introduced the "Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet" framework, a novel approach to fetal health classification that addresses critical challenges in Cardiotocogram (CTG) analysis, including class imbalance, static data representation, high dimensionality, and lack of prediction confidence. By integrating SHAP-driven feature selection with LightGBM, pseudo-temporal data simulation, dual Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGAN) for synthetic data generation, and an uncertainty-aware TabNet classifier with permutation regularization, our framework achieved a classification accuracy of 96% and a mean prediction uncertainty of 0.2264 on the Fetal Health Classification dataset. The model’s performance, with F1-scores of 0.94 (Normal), 0.94 (Suspect), and 0.98 (Pathological), surpasses prior approaches such as LightGBM (89% accuracy, F1 ~0.87) and static TabNet (91%, F1 ~0.89), demonstrating its superior ability to detect critical Pathological cases while maintaining robust performance across all classes.

Our methodology offers several key contributions to maternal-fetal medicine and AI-driven healthcare. First, SHAP analysis enabled a data-driven reduction from 22 to 10 features, focusing on clinically relevant predictors like `histogram_mean` and `abnormal_short_term_variability`, enhancing interpretability and computational efficiency. Second, the dual CTGAN approach effectively balanced the dataset to ~1,655 samples per class, preserving temporal dynamics and improving minority class detection over traditional methods like SMOTE and ADASYN. Third, pseudo-temporal simulation transformed static CTG data into 5-step time series, capturing dynamic fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns essential for distress detection, a capability static models lack. Finally, the uncertainty-aware TabNet, optimized via Optuna and enhanced with Monte Carlo Dropout, provided reliable confidence metrics (mean uncertainty 0.2264), enabling clinicians to flag ambiguous predictions for further review, thus bridging the gap between AI predictions and clinical decision-making.

The clinical implications of this framework are profound. With a 98% recall for Pathological cases, the model facilitates early detection of fetal distress, potentially preventing 5-10 adverse neonatal outcomes annually per 5,000 deliveries by guiding timely interventions such as cesarean sections. The temporal modeling aligns with real-time CTG monitoring practices, capturing dynamic FHR trends like decelerations and variability shifts, which are critical indicators of hypoxia. Moreover, the uncertainty quantification ensures clinical trust by highlighting predictions that require additional scrutiny, a feature absent in deterministic models. These advancements position our framework as a transformative tool for labor management, reducing unnecessary interventions, optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes, and lowering healthcare costs associated with neonatal intensive care.

Despite its strengths, this study has limitations that warrant further exploration. The pseudo-temporal simulation, while effective, relies on synthetic noise (±0.05) rather than true time-series CTG data, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world FHR dynamics. The dataset, although balanced post-CTGAN, originates from a single source (UCI Repository), limiting generalizability across diverse populations and clinical settings. Additionally, the uncertainty threshold (>0.3) for flagging ambiguous predictions lacks clinical validation, and the model’s real-time deployment feasibility remains untested due to the absence of latency metrics and integration with existing CTG systems. Finally, while the 96% accuracy is statistically significant (p < 0.05 via paired t-test), the single train-test split approach may overestimate performance compared to k-fold cross-validation.

Future work will address these limitations by incorporating real-time CTG streams to validate temporal modeling, potentially through collaboration with obstetric units. Multi-center studies across diverse populations will enhance generalizability, while clinical trials with obstetricians will refine the uncertainty threshold and assess real-world impact on labor outcomes. Additionally, integrating multi-modal data (e.g., maternal blood pressure, ultrasound metrics) could further improve prediction accuracy, and exploring transfer learning may enable adaptation to resource-limited settings. Finally, deploying the model in a real-time CTG system with latency optimization will solidify its practical utility, paving the way for widespread adoption in prenatal care.

In conclusion, the "Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet" framework sets a new standard for AI-driven fetal health classification, offering a scalable, interpretable, and clinically relevant solution. By addressing data challenges and enhancing prediction reliability, this work not only advances maternal-fetal medicine but also demonstrates the potential of AI to transform high-stakes clinical decision-making, ultimately improving outcomes for mothers and newborns worldwide.
