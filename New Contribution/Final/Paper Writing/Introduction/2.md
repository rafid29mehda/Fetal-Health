### Introduction

Cardiotocography (CTG) remains the cornerstone of fetal monitoring during pregnancy and labor, offering critical insights into fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (UC) to identify fetal distress—a key indicator of adverse outcomes such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), cerebral palsy (CP), and perinatal mortality (Ingemarsson, 2009). Globally, the stakes are immense: the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that intrapartum complications contribute to over 700,000 maternal deaths annually, with inadequate fetal monitoring playing a significant role in preventable morbidity (WHO, 2023). Despite its widespread adoption, CTG interpretation is plagued by persistent challenges. Manual analysis, guided by standards such as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines (Ayres-de-Campos et al., 2015), suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability, resulting in inconsistent diagnoses and delayed interventions (Grivell et al., 2015). Furthermore, the rarity of pathological CTG cases—approximately 2 per 1,000 births for CP (Ingemarsson, 2009)—creates a critical bottleneck: insufficient data to train robust predictive models, leaving clinicians reliant on subjective expertise in high-stakes scenarios.

Efforts to address these limitations through automated systems have met with mixed success. Rule-based tools like SisPorto (Ayres-de-Campos & Bernardes, 2004) aim to standardize CTG interpretation by automating pattern recognition, yet they struggle to capture the nuanced, non-linear dynamics of fetal physiology, yielding high false-positive rates and missing critical events (Grivell et al., 2015). The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities, with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) demonstrating prowess in deciphering complex patterns from medical data. However, their application to CTG analysis faces two formidable hurdles: the scarcity of annotated pathological datasets and the opaque nature of most AI models, which undermines clinical trust and adoption. Recent innovations, such as conditional generative adversarial networks (CTGAN) for synthetic data generation (Xu et al., 2019) and interpretable tabular learning frameworks like TabNet (Arık & Pfister, 2021), offer promising avenues to bridge these gaps. Synthetic data can augment limited real-world samples, while interpretable models provide clinicians with actionable insights, aligning AI outputs with physiological understanding.

The global health implications of improving CTG analysis are profound, particularly in low-resource settings where misinterpretation of fetal distress exacerbates preventable mortality (WHO, 2023). Even in well-equipped facilities, systematic reviews, including the Cochrane analysis of antenatal CTG, reveal its limited impact on reducing perinatal mortality beyond neonatal seizures, underscoring the need for enhanced predictive tools (Grivell et al., 2015). This study introduces a groundbreaking framework that integrates CTGAN-generated synthetic CTG data with TabNet’s interpretable deep learning to revolutionize fetal distress prediction. By synthesizing realistic CTG traces to overcome data scarcity (Xu et al., 2019) and employing TabNet’s attention-based architecture to deliver transparent, feature-selective classifications (Arık & Pfister, 2021), our approach not only boosts model performance on rare pathological cases but also fosters clinical trust through explainability. Grounded in established clinical benchmarks (Ayres-de-Campos et al., 2015) and leveraging cutting-edge AI, this work aspires to set a new standard in fetal monitoring, with scalable potential to mitigate adverse maternal-fetal outcomes worldwide.

Our methodology diverges sharply from prior AI efforts in CTG analysis. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to FHR spectrograms or ensemble methods like XGBoost have shown promise, they often falter in generalizability and lack the interpretability demanded by clinicians. In contrast, our use of CTGAN produces synthetic datasets validated for fidelity to real CTG traces (Xu et al., 2019), enabling robust training on underrepresented pathological events. Simultaneously, TabNet’s attention mechanism highlights key features driving predictions, aligning them with clinical guidelines and surpassing the limitations of black-box models (Arık & Pfister, 2021). This dual innovation addresses three pivotal challenges: data scarcity, model transparency, and real-time applicability across diverse healthcare settings. As maternal and fetal health remain urgent global priorities (WHO, 2023), this study marks a transformative step toward precision obstetrics, promising to enhance decision-making and reduce the burden of preventable adverse outcomes.
