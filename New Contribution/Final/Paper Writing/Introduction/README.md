## 1. Introduction

Cardiotocography (CTG) is a cornerstone of fetal health monitoring, providing critical insights into fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction patterns during pregnancy and labor. With over 130 million births annually worldwide [1], ensuring fetal well-being is a global health priority, as adverse outcomes like hypoxia, stillbirth, or neonatal morbidity affect 1–3% of deliveries [2]. Early detection of fetal distress through CTG can trigger timely interventions—such as cesarean delivery or oxygen therapy—potentially reducing neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions and long-term developmental impairments, which carry significant emotional and economic costs (e.g., $50,000–$100,000 per NICU case [3]). However, manual CTG interpretation by clinicians is subjective, time-intensive, and prone to inter-observer variability (e.g., 20–30% disagreement rates [4]), underscoring the need for automated, reliable tools. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer transformative potential to enhance prenatal care, yet their adoption hinges on addressing data-specific challenges and ensuring clinical trustworthiness.

Despite its widespread use, CTG analysis presents formidable obstacles for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The Fetal Health Classification dataset, a benchmark with 2,126 samples, exemplifies these issues: severe class imbalance (Normal: 77.8%, Suspect: 13.9%, Pathological: 8.3%) biases models toward the majority class, compromising detection of rare but critical Pathological cases [5]. Additionally, the dataset’s static feature summaries (e.g., `abnormal_short_term_variability`, `histogram_variance`) overlook the temporal dynamics inherent in continuous CTG monitoring, limiting the ability to capture evolving distress patterns [6]. High dimensionality (22 features) introduces noise and computational complexity, while the absence of prediction confidence in most models risks overconfidence or missed diagnoses, undermining clinical utility [7]. These challenges—imbalance, static representation, dimensionality, and lack of trust—collectively hinder the real-world impact of existing AI solutions in maternal-fetal medicine.

Prior work has made strides in CTG classification but falls short of a comprehensive solution. Traditional ML models like LightGBM achieve 93–95% accuracy with techniques like SMOTE for imbalance [8], yet they treat data statically and lack uncertainty metrics, reducing sensitivity to Pathological cases (e.g., F1 ~0.85 [8]). Static TabNet, a DL approach leveraging attention mechanisms, reaches 96% accuracy [9], but it similarly ignores temporal context and provides no confidence estimates, limiting its practical reliability. Other DL methods, such as LSTMs, excel with true time-series but struggle with tabular data and require extensive real temporal datasets unavailable in this domain [10]. Synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE, ADASYN) improves class balance but produces noisy, static samples [11], while feature selection often relies on heuristics rather than interpretable methods [12]. No prior study integrates temporal modeling, robust imbalance correction, dimensionality reduction, and uncertainty quantification into a single framework, leaving a gap for an AI tool that fully aligns with clinical needs.

We propose "Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet," a novel framework that synergistically addresses these limitations to advance fetal health detection. Our approach integrates: (1) SHAP-driven feature selection with LightGBM to reduce 22 features to 10 clinically relevant predictors, (2) pseudo-temporal simulation (5 steps, ±5% noise) to capture dynamic CTG patterns, (3) dual Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGAN) to balance classes (~1,655 samples each), (4) an uncertainty-aware TabNet classifier with Monte Carlo Dropout (mean uncertainty 0.2292), and (5) permutation regularization for robustness, optimized via Optuna. Achieving 96% accuracy and superior Pathological detection (F1 ~0.92), our model outperforms LightGBM (93%) and static TabNet (96% without uncertainty), offering interpretable, trustworthy predictions. This paper aims to demonstrate how this framework enhances early distress detection, optimizes labor management, and improves maternal-fetal outcomes, setting a new standard for AI-driven prenatal care. By solving data and trust challenges, we pave the way for scalable, real-world deployment in diverse healthcare settings, from urban hospitals to resource-limited regions.
