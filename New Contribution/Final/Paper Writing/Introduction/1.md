### Introduction

Cardiotocography (CTG) remains the cornerstone of fetal monitoring during pregnancy and labor, offering a non-invasive window into fetal well-being through the continuous recording of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (UC). Introduced in the 1960s, CTG has been widely adopted to detect fetal distress, a condition often marked by hypoxia that, if unaddressed, can lead to severe outcomes such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), cerebral palsy (CP), or perinatal mortality (Ingemarsson, 2009). Despite its ubiquity, the clinical utility of CTG is hampered by significant challenges. Visual interpretation, guided by standards such as those from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) (Ayres-de-Campos et al., 2015), suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability, contributing to inconsistent diagnoses and suboptimal intervention timing (Grivell et al., 2015). This subjectivity has fueled a global health burden, with the World Health Organization estimating that intrapartum complications contribute to over 700,000 maternal deaths annually, many linked to inadequate fetal monitoring (WHO, 2023). Moreover, the rarity of pathological CTG cases—approximately 2 per 1,000 births for CP (Ingemarsson, 2009)—poses a data scarcity problem, limiting the development of robust predictive models.

Traditional approaches to CTG analysis, such as rule-based systems like SisPorto (Ayres-de-Campos & Bernardes, 2004), have aimed to standardize interpretation by automating baseline FHR detection and pattern recognition. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dynamics of fetal physiology, leading to persistent false positives and missed detections (Grivell et al., 2015). The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) offers a transformative opportunity to address these limitations. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promise in extracting intricate patterns from tabular and time-series data, yet their application to CTG has been constrained by insufficient high-quality datasets and a lack of interpretability—critical for clinical adoption. Recent innovations, such as conditional generative adversarial networks (CTGAN) for synthetic data generation (Parise et al., 2025) and attentive interpretable tabular learning (TabNet) (Arık & Pfister, 2021), provide novel tools to overcome these barriers. Synthetic data can augment limited real-world CTG samples, while interpretable models can align AI predictions with clinical decision-making, enhancing trust and utility.

The pressing need for improved fetal distress prediction is underscored by the global disparity in maternal-fetal outcomes. In low-resource settings, where access to advanced diagnostics is limited, misinterpretation of CTG traces exacerbates preventable morbidity and mortality (WHO, 2023). Even in high-resource environments, the Cochrane review of antenatal CTG highlights its failure to reduce perinatal mortality beyond neonatal seizures, signaling a gap in predictive accuracy (Grivell et al., 2015). This study introduces a pioneering framework that synergistically combines synthetic CTG data generation with an interpretable deep learning model to enhance fetal distress prediction. Leveraging CTGAN to generate realistic synthetic CTG traces (Parise et al., 2025) and TabNet for attentive, feature-selective classification (Arık & Pfister, 2021), our approach addresses data scarcity, improves model performance on rare pathological cases, and provides clinicians with transparent insights into prediction rationales. By building on established clinical guidelines (Ayres-de-Campos et al., 2015) and integrating advanced AI techniques, this work aims to redefine the standard of care in fetal monitoring, offering a scalable solution with potential to reduce adverse outcomes worldwide.

Our methodology departs from conventional ML approaches by tackling three core challenges: the paucity of annotated pathological CTG data, the black-box nature of many DL models, and the need for real-time applicability in diverse clinical settings. Previous efforts, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to FHR spectrograms or tree-based ensembles like XGBoost, have achieved moderate success but often lack generalizability or interpretability. In contrast, our use of CTGAN-generated synthetic data—validated for coherence with real CTG traces (Parise et al., 2025)—enables robust training on rare events, while TabNet’s attention mechanism ensures that feature importance aligns with physiological understanding (Arık & Pfister, 2021). This dual innovation not only elevates predictive accuracy but also bridges the gap between AI research and clinical practice, responding to calls for explainable AI in healthcare. As maternal and fetal health remain critical priorities on the global stage (WHO, 2023), this study represents a significant step toward precision obstetrics, promising to enhance decision-making and ultimately save lives.
