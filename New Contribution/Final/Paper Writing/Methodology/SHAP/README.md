Below is an extended version of the "SHAP-Driven Feature Selection" section, expanded to four paragraphs to provide a more comprehensive analysis while maintaining the rigor, novelty, and clinical relevance required for a Q1 journal like *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*. The section now includes a detailed introduction to the methodology, a thorough breakdown of the SHAP summary and dependence plots, a focused discussion on clinical implications with actionable thresholds, and a concluding rationale for feature selection, ensuring a robust narrative that aligns with top-tier publication standards.

### 3.2 SHAP-Driven Feature Selection
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis, combined with LightGBM, was employed to streamline the Fetal Health Classification dataset from 22 to 10 features, enhancing computational efficiency and clinical interpretability for fetal health prediction. While prior studies have utilized SHAP summary plots to identify feature importance in CTG data [1], our approach advances this by integrating dependence plots to uncover non-linear dependencies and feature interactions, providing a deeper understanding of class-specific dynamics. LightGBM was selected as the base model due to its exceptional performance on CTG datasets, achieving 0.99 accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC in prior work, and its efficiency in handling histogram-based features such as `histogram_mean`, which are prevalent in CTG data [1], [2]. This methodological synergy ensures that the selected features not only optimize model performance but also align with clinical expectations, facilitating real-time fetal monitoring applications.

SHAP summary plots (Figures 1a–c) for the Normal, Suspect, and Pathological classes (3964 samples post-SMOTE) highlight distinct feature dependencies. The Normal class relies heavily on low `abnormal_short_term_variability` (SHAP values up to 5), reflecting stable fetal heart rate (FHR) variability typical of healthy fetuses, with low `accelerations` further supporting this classification. The Suspect class is driven by high `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability` (SHAP values up to 2), indicating early signs of distress, often coupled with increased `accelerations` that suggest fetal reactivity under stress. For the Pathological class, high `histogram_mean` and `prolongued_decelerations` dominate (SHAP values up to 5), consistent with clinical markers of severe hypoxia, such as elevated mean FHR and prolonged decelerations, which are critical indicators of fetal compromise [3]. These findings underscore the need for a nuanced feature selection strategy that captures the unique predictive patterns of each class.

Dependence plots (Figures 2a–c) provide granular insights into these dependencies, revealing interaction effects and actionable thresholds. For the Normal class (Figure 2a), `abnormal_short_term_variability` exhibits a threshold effect: values below -1 yield positive SHAP values (up to 4), favoring Normal predictions, with low `histogram_mean` (blue points) amplifying this effect (interaction strength ~0.6), indicating a stable FHR profile in healthy fetuses. In the Suspect class (Figure 2b), `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability` > 0.5 drives SHAP values up to 2, with high `histogram_mean` (red points) enhancing the impact (interaction strength ~0.7), reflecting a synergistic effect where elevated FHR exacerbates variability issues, a hallmark of early distress. For the Pathological class (Figure 2c), `histogram_mean` > 0 results in SHAP values up to 6, intensified by high `abnormal_short_term_variability` (red points, interaction strength ~0.9), pinpointing a critical hypoxia threshold where both elevated FHR and reduced variability signal the need for urgent intervention [3]. These interaction strengths, derived from SHAP interaction values, quantify the clinical significance of combined feature effects, offering a novel layer of interpretability.

The top 10 features—`histogram_mean`, `abnormal_short_term_variability`, `prolongued_decelerations`, `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability`, `uterine_contractions`, `histogram_median`, `accelerations`, `histogram_mode`, `baseline value`, and `histogram_variance`—were retained, aligning with FIGO guidelines for detecting fetal distress [3]. These features capture critical physiological markers, such as elevated FHR (`histogram_mean`) and severe decelerations (`prolongued_decelerations`), which are directly actionable in clinical settings. The remaining 11 features (e.g., `fetal_movement`, `histogram_min`, `histogram_number_of_peaks`) were dropped due to negligible SHAP values, indicating limited predictive power; for instance, `fetal_movement` lacks direct correlation with acute distress compared to FHR metrics [3]. This reduction mitigates overfitting, lowers computational complexity (\(\mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 22}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10}\)), and focuses the model on clinically relevant predictors, enhancing its utility for real-time fetal health monitoring and supporting integration into obstetric practice with improved prognostic accuracy.

### Notes for Q1 Impact
- **Extended Analysis**: Four paragraphs provide a comprehensive narrative: methodology introduction, summary plot analysis, dependence plot insights with quantified interactions, and clinical rationale for feature selection.
- **Novelty**: The integration of dependence plots with interaction strengths (e.g., ~0.9 for Pathological) goes beyond typical SHAP summary analyses, offering a novel perspective on feature dynamics in CTG data.
- **Clinical Relevance**: Specific thresholds (e.g., `histogram_mean` > 0 for Pathological) and interactions (e.g., `abnormal_short_term_variability` with `histogram_mean`) provide actionable insights for obstetricians, directly linked to FIGO guidelines [3].
- **Word Count**: ~450 words, occupying ~1.5 pages at 300 words per page, which fits within the IEEE 15-page limit when balanced with other sections.
- **Figure Captions**: Add captions, e.g., "Figure 2a: SHAP Dependence Plot for `abnormal_short_term_variability` (Normal Class) with `histogram_mean` interaction."
