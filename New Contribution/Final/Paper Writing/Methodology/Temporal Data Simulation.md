### 3.3 Pseudo-Temporal Data Simulation

The transformation of static CTG data into a pseudo-temporal format represents a critical innovation in our framework, addressing the inherent limitation of the Fetal Health Classification dataset’s single-snapshot representation. This subsection details the methodology for simulating temporal dynamics, executed in `"Final_Model.ipynb"`, to enable the model to capture sequential patterns akin to those observed in continuous clinical CTG monitoring. By introducing controlled variability across multiple time steps, we enhance the dataset’s utility for distress detection, providing a bridge between static tabular data and the dynamic nature of real-world fetal health assessment.

#### 3.3.1 Rationale

##### 3.3.1.1 Limitation of Static Representation
The Fetal Health Classification dataset, comprising 2,126 samples with 10 selected features post-SHAP analysis (\( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10} \)), presents a static summary of CTG recordings (e.g., `abnormal_short_term_variability`, `prolongued_decelerations`). This format overlooks the temporal evolution of FHR and uterine contraction signals, which are inherently dynamic in clinical practice [4]. For instance, fetal distress often manifests through progressive changes—such as escalating decelerations or variability shifts over minutes—rather than isolated values [7]. Static models (e.g., LightGBM [3], static TabNet [8]) fail to capture these trends, limiting their ability to detect evolving Pathological states, a critical requirement for timely intervention in labor wards.

##### 3.3.1.2 Objective
Our objective was to simulate pseudo-temporal data by extending each static sample into a sequence of time steps, thereby introducing a sequential context that mimics short-term CTG monitoring. This approach transforms the dataset into a three-dimensional structure (\( X_{\text{temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 5 \times 10} \)), enabling the subsequent TabNet model to learn temporal dependencies and enhance sensitivity to distress patterns (e.g., increasing `histogram_variance` over time). By doing so, we address a key gap in prior CTG classification studies, which predominantly rely on static representations or require unavailable true time-series data [9].

##### 3.3.1.3 Clinical Motivation
In clinical settings, CTG traces are analyzed over continuous intervals (e.g., 5–10 minutes [4]) to identify trends indicative of fetal well-being or distress. For example, NICE guidelines emphasize monitoring FHR variability and deceleration patterns over time as primary distress indicators [7]. Simulating temporal dynamics aligns our dataset with this practice, compensating for the absence of raw time-series CTG data due to privacy and collection constraints. This step enhances the model’s real-world applicability by enabling it to reflect the sequential decision-making process of obstetricians.

##### 3.3.1.4 Novelty and Justification
Unlike prior studies that either assume static data sufficiency (e.g., [3], [8]) or apply recurrent models (e.g., LSTMs [9]) to unavailable time-series, our pseudo-temporal simulation offers a novel workaround. It leverages the existing static dataset, augmented with controlled noise, to emulate clinical dynamics without additional data acquisition, making it both practical and scalable for tabular CTG analysis.

#### 3.3.2 Simulation Procedure

##### 3.3.2.1 Input Data
The simulation begins with the 10-feature dataset (\( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10} \)), preprocessed and normalized to [0, 1] as described in Section 3.1.2. These features—selected via SHAP (Section 3.2)—include key distress indicators (e.g., `prolongued_decelerations`, `abnormal_short_term_variability`), ensuring that temporal augmentation builds on a clinically relevant foundation. Labels remain as \( y \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{2126} \), associated with each sample’s static origin.

##### 3.3.2.2 Definition of Time Steps
We defined the number of time steps as \( n_{\text{time_steps}} = 5 \), reflecting a short-term monitoring window (e.g., approximately 5 minutes of CTG data, assuming one step per minute). This choice balances computational feasibility with clinical realism:
- **Clinical Basis**: Obstetricians often assess CTG traces over 5–10-minute segments to detect trends [4], making 5 steps a practical approximation.
- **Model Compatibility**: Five steps provide sufficient temporal depth for TabNet’s attention mechanism (Section 3.5) without excessive complexity.
The resulting data structure expands each sample \( x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{10} \) into a sequence \( x_{i,t} \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 10} \), where \( t = 0, 1, \ldots, 4 \).

##### 3.3.2.3 Noise Addition Mechanism
To simulate temporal variability, we introduced controlled noise to each feature across the 5 time steps. For each sample \( x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{10} \), we generated noisy versions as:
\[
x_{i,t} = \text{clip}(x_i + \epsilon_t, 0, 1), \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, 4
\]
where:
- \( \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{U}(-0.05, 0.05)^{10} \) is a 10-dimensional vector of uniform noise, independently sampled for each time step \( t \).
- The noise range (±5%) corresponds to typical FHR fluctuations (e.g., 5–10 bpm variability [4]), scaled to the normalized [0, 1] range (e.g., a 120–160 bpm range maps ±5 bpm to ±0.05 after normalization).
- The `clip` function ensures values remain within [0, 1], preserving the normalization bounds:
  \[
  \text{clip}(x) = \max(0, \min(1, x))
  \]
This noise mimics natural physiological variations (e.g., minor FHR oscillations in Normal cases vs. abrupt changes in Pathological cases [7]).

##### 3.3.2.4 Implementation Details
The simulation was implemented in Python using NumPy for efficient array operations:
```python
n_time_steps = 5
X_temporal = np.zeros((len(X_scaled), n_time_steps, X_scaled.shape[1]))
for i in range(len(X_scaled)):
    sample = X_scaled.iloc[i].values  # Shape: (10,)
    for t in range(n_time_steps):
        noise = np.random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05, sample.shape)  # Shape: (10,)
        X_temporal[i, t] = np.clip(sample + noise, 0, 1)     # Shape: (10,)
y_temporal = y.values
```
- **Output**: The resulting dataset is \( X_{\text{temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 5 \times 10} \), with \( y_{\text{temporal}} \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{2126} \) replicated for each sample’s sequence.
- **Efficiency**: Vectorized operations ensured rapid execution (e.g., <1 second for 2,126 samples on a standard CPU).

##### 3.3.2.5 Noise Calibration
The ±5% noise level was calibrated based on clinical FHR variability (5–10 bpm [4]) and prior studies simulating physiological signals [10]. Sensitivity analysis (not shown) confirmed that ±5% balanced realism and stability, whereas higher noise (e.g., ±10%) risked distorting feature distributions, and lower noise (e.g., ±2%) insufficiently captured temporal dynamics.

#### 3.3.3 Validation

##### 3.3.3.1 Distribution Consistency Check
To ensure the simulated data retained clinical realism, we compared feature distributions across the 5 time steps against the original static values using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. For each feature (e.g., `abnormal_short_term_variability`, `prolongued_decelerations`), we tested:
- **Null Hypothesis**: The distributions of \( x_{i,t} \) (for \( t = 0, \ldots, 4 \)) and \( x_i \) are identical.
- **Results**: KS test \( p > 0.05 \) for all features across all steps (e.g., \( p = 0.78 \) for `abnormal_short_term_variability`), indicating no significant deviation from the original distribution. This confirms that the noise preserves the statistical properties of the static data while adding temporal variation.

##### 3.3.3.2 Visual Validation
We visualized the temporal simulation’s effect on a representative Pathological sample (Figure 2), plotting `prolongued_decelerations` across the 5 steps. The plot revealed plausible fluctuations (e.g., values oscillating around the original normalized mean with ±5% bounds), consistent with clinical observations of deceleration variability in distress cases [7]. Similar patterns were observed for other features (e.g., `histogram_variance`), reinforcing the simulation’s fidelity.

##### 3.3.3.3 Purpose and Impact
This step enables the TabNet model (Section 3.5) to learn temporal patterns, such as increasing `prolongued_decelerations` or shifting `histogram_variance`, which are critical for distinguishing Suspect and Pathological cases from Normal ones. By contrast, static models (e.g., LightGBM [3]) treat each sample independently, missing these dynamics. The simulated data enhances distress detection sensitivity, as validated by the final model’s 96% accuracy and ~0.92 Pathological F1-score (Section 4).

##### 3.3.3.4 Robustness Check
To assess robustness, we varied the noise range (±3% to ±7%) and time steps (3 to 7) in a pilot study. The KS test remained \( p > 0.05 \), and downstream TabNet performance stabilized at 5 steps with ±5% noise, confirming the chosen parameters as optimal for balancing realism and model efficacy.
