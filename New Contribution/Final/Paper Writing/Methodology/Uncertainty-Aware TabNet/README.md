### Uncertainty-Aware TabNet with Permutation Regularization
The final predictive model in our framework is an enhanced TabNet architecture, termed "Uncertainty-Aware TabNet," designed for fetal health classification using the temporally augmented dataset (\(X_{\text{gan_temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{4965 \times 5 \times 10}\)). Implemented in "Final_Model.ipynb," this model integrates Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout for uncertainty quantification and permutation regularization for robustness, addressing limitations of deterministic models like LightGBM (93% accuracy) [3]. Achieving 96% accuracy and a mean uncertainty of 0.2292, it outperforms static TabNet (96% without uncertainty) and provides clinically actionable confidence metrics, enhancing maternal-fetal care decision-making.

The base TabNet architecture, extended from pytorch-tabnet (v4.1) [1], processes flattened 50-feature inputs (5 time steps \(\times\) 10 features) using a sequential attention mechanism with sparsemax activation for sparse feature selection. We modified it with MC Dropout (p=0.3) to estimate prediction uncertainty, performing 50 forward passes to compute mean probabilities (\(\mu(X) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} p_t(X)\)) and standard deviation (\(\sigma(X) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (p_t(X) - \mu(X))^2}\), \(T=50\)) [2]. This design flags ambiguous predictions (e.g., \(\sigma > 0.3\)) for review, a critical feature in high-stakes clinical settings [5], unlike point-estimate models.

Permutation regularization augments robustness by randomly reordering the 5 time steps in 10% of training samples, simulating CTG acquisition variability. Implemented as \(X_{\text{aug}} = X[\text{perm}]\) for selected samples (permutation_prob=0.1), this forces the model to learn order-invariant patterns, improving generalization (1–2% accuracy gain on permuted test data) [5]. Calibrated via sensitivity analysis (5%–20% probabilities), 10% balanced robustness and temporal coherence, complementing uncertainty quantification by addressing input-level noise.

Data preparation involved stratified splitting of the balanced dataset: 70% train (3,475 samples), 30% test (1,490 samples), with 20% of train as validation (695 samples), preserving class ratios (~1,655 per class) using train_test_split with stratify. The data was flattened to \(\mathbb{R}^{n \times 50}\) (e.g., \(X_{\text{train_flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{3475 \times 50}\)) to match TabNet’s input, with integrity verified by consistent feature statistics pre- and post-reshaping.

Hyperparameter optimization used Optuna (v3.0) [6] over 50 trials, maximizing validation accuracy. Optimal parameters included \(n_d=64\), \(n_a=64\), \(n_steps=5\), \(\gamma=1.3\), \(\lambda_{\text{sparse}}=1e-3\), learning_rate=0.02, and batch_size=256, selected via Bayesian optimization to align with the 5-step temporal structure and ensure stability on a CUDA-enabled GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4).

Training initialized the UncertaintyTabNet with optimal settings, applying permutation augmentation before fitting with the Adam optimizer over 100 epochs, using early stopping (patience=20) on validation loss (~15 minutes runtime). Training dynamics converged by epoch 80 (Figure 5), preventing overfitting, with loss and accuracy monitored to validate model stability.

Evaluation metrics included accuracy (96%), per-class F1-scores (e.g., Pathological ~0.92), and a confusion matrix (Figure 6) to assess class-wise performance. Uncertainty (\(\sigma\)) averaged 0.2292 across test samples, with thresholds (e.g., \(\sigma > 0.3\)) guiding clinical triage—low uncertainty (\(\sigma < 0.2\)) supports confident decisions, while high values prompt review [5].

This approach enhances TabNet’s ability to detect temporal distress patterns, such as escalating `prolongued_decelerations`, critical for distinguishing Pathological cases. By quantifying uncertainty and improving robustness, it aligns with clinical needs for reliable, interpretable predictions, surpassing static models and supporting real-time deployment in labor wards.

The integration of uncertainty and permutation regularization represents a novel advancement, addressing both prediction confidence and data variability in CTG analysis. This methodology not only improves performance but also bridges the gap between machine learning and clinical practice, offering a robust tool for fetal health monitoring.
