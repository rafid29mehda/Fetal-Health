### 3.5 Uncertainty-Aware TabNet with Permutation Regularization

The final predictive component of our framework leverages an enhanced TabNet architecture tailored for fetal health classification, incorporating uncertainty quantification and permutation regularization to address the limitations of deterministic and static models. This subsection details the design, training, and evaluation of the "Uncertainty-Aware TabNet," implemented in `"Final_Model.ipynb"`, which processes the temporally augmented and balanced dataset (\( X_{\text{gan_temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{4965 \times 5 \times 10} \)) to deliver accurate predictions with confidence metrics. By integrating Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty and permutation regularization for robustness, our approach achieves 96% accuracy and a mean uncertainty of 0.2292, surpassing baselines like LightGBM (93%) and static TabNet (96% without uncertainty), and providing a clinically actionable tool for maternal-fetal care.

#### 3.5.1 Model Architecture

##### 3.5.1.1 Base TabNet Framework
We extended the `TabNetClassifier` from `pytorch-tabnet` (v4.1) [1], a deep learning model optimized for tabular data, which uses a sequential attention mechanism to focus on relevant features at each decision step. The base architecture accepts a flattened input of 50 features (from \( 5 \times 10 \) temporal steps), processes it through multiple steps (controlled by `n_steps`), and outputs probabilities for 3 classes (Normal, Suspect, Pathological). The `sparsemax` activation ensures sparse feature selection, enhancing interpretability over traditional dense neural networks [1].

##### 3.5.1.2 Uncertainty Integration
To quantify prediction confidence—a critical requirement for clinical deployment—we modified TabNet to incorporate Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout [2]:
```python
class UncertaintyTabNet(TabNetClassifier):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.3).to(device)
    def predict_proba(self, X):
        self.eval()
        X_tensor = torch.tensor(X, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
        probs = [torch.softmax(self.forward(X_tensor)[0], dim=1).cpu().numpy() 
                 for _ in range(50)]
        return np.mean(probs, axis=0), np.std(probs, axis=0)
```
- **Input**: \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 50} \) (flattened temporal data).
- **Output**: Three-class probabilities (Normal, Suspect, Pathological).
- **Dropout**: Added a 30% dropout layer (`p=0.3`), applied during inference to simulate model variability.
- **MC Dropout**: Performed 50 forward passes with dropout enabled, computing:
  \[
  \mu(X) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} p_t(X), \quad \sigma(X) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (p_t(X) - \mu(X))^2}
  \]
  where \( T = 50 \), \( p_t(X) \) is the softmax probability from pass \( t \), \( \mu(X) \) is the mean probability, and \( \sigma(X) \) is the uncertainty (standard deviation).

##### 3.5.1.3 Rationale for Uncertainty
Unlike deterministic models (e.g., LightGBM [3], static TabNet [4]), which provide point estimates without confidence, our uncertainty-aware design flags ambiguous predictions (e.g., \( \sigma(X) > 0.3 \)) for clinical review, reducing false positives/negatives in high-stakes settings [5]. The 30% dropout rate and 50 passes were chosen to balance computational cost and uncertainty precision, informed by prior studies [2].

##### 3.5.1.4 Architectural Details
- **Feature Transformer**: Multi-layer perceptrons with `n_d` (decision) and `n_a` (attention) units process inputs.
- **Attention Mechanism**: `sparsemax` selects features per step, with sparsity controlled by `lambda_sparse`.
- **Output Layer**: Softmax over 3 classes, adjusted for MC Dropout during inference.

#### 3.5.2 Permutation Regularization

##### 3.5.2.1 Objective
To enhance robustness against variability in temporal feature order—simulating real-world CTG device inconsistencies—we introduced permutation regularization as a data augmentation strategy.

##### 3.5.2.2 Method
We permuted the order of the 5 time steps in 10% of training samples:
```python
def augment_data(X, y, permutation_prob=0.1):
    X_aug = X.copy()
    for i in range(len(X)):
        if np.random.rand() < permutation_prob:
            perm = np.random.permutation(X.shape[1])  # Permute axis 1 (time steps)
            X_aug[i] = X[i, perm]
    return X_aug, y
```
- **Input**: \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 5 \times 10} \).
- **Process**: Randomly reorders the 5 time steps (e.g., [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] to [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]) for 10% of samples.
- **Probability**: \( \text{permutation_prob} = 0.1 \) ensures moderate augmentation without overwhelming the original structure.

##### 3.5.2.3 Rationale and Impact
Permutation mimics noise in CTG acquisition (e.g., misaligned time stamps), forcing the model to learn order-invariant patterns. This improves generalization, as validated by a 1–2% accuracy gain on permuted test data compared to non-regularized TabNet (Section 4). Unlike dropout, which acts on weights, permutation targets input robustness, complementing uncertainty quantification.

##### 3.5.2.4 Calibration
We tested permutation probabilities (5%–20%), finding 10% optimal for balancing robustness and training stability, avoiding excessive disruption of temporal coherence critical for distress detection [5].

#### 3.5.3 Data Splitting and Preparation

##### 3.5.3.1 Stratified Splitting
The balanced dataset (\( X_{\text{gan_temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{4965 \times 5 \times 10} \), \( y_{\text{gan_temporal}} \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{4965} \)) was split:
- **Train**: 70% (3,475 samples).
- **Test**: 30% (1,490 samples).
- **Validation**: 20% of train (695 samples, from 3,475).
- **Method**: Used `train_test_split` with `stratify=y_gan_temporal`:
  ```python
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_gan_temporal, y_gan_temporal, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y_gan_temporal)
  X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_train)
  ```
- **Purpose**: Stratification preserves the balanced class ratio (~1,655 per class), ensuring representative subsets.

##### 3.5.3.2 Flattening
Each subset was flattened for TabNet input:
- **Process**: Reshaped \( \mathbb{R}^{n \times 5 \times 10} \) to \( \mathbb{R}^{n \times 50} \) (e.g., \( X_{\text{train_flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{3475 \times 50} \)).
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  X_train_flat = X_train.reshape(len(X_train), -1)
  X_val_flat = X_val.reshape(len(X_val), -1)
  X_test_flat = X_test.reshape(len(X_test), -1)
  ```
- **Rationale**: Flattening aligns with TabNet’s input requirements while retaining temporal information as sequential features.

##### 3.5.3.3 Data Integrity
Verified that flattening preserved values (e.g., mean `prolongued_decelerations` consistent pre- and post-reshaping), ensuring no distortion before training.

#### 3.5.4 Hyperparameter Optimization

##### 3.5.4.1 Optimization Tool
We used Optuna (v3.0) [6] for hyperparameter tuning over 50 trials:
- **Objective**: Maximize validation accuracy.
- **Parameters**:
  - `n_d`, `n_a`: 32–128 (feature transformer units).
  - `n_steps`: 3–10 (attention steps).
  - `gamma`: 1.0–2.0 (relaxation parameter).
  - `lambda_sparse`: 1e-4–1e-2 (sparsity regularization).
  - `learning_rate`: 1e-3–1e-1.
  - `batch_size`: {128, 256, 512}.

##### 3.5.4.2 Best Configuration
Example optimal parameters:
- `n_d=64`, `n_a=64`, `n_steps=5`, `gamma=1.3`, `lambda_sparse=1e-3`, `learning_rate=0.02`, `batch_size=256`.
- **Selection**: Chosen via Bayesian optimization, minimizing overfitting while maximizing accuracy (96% on validation).

##### 3.5.4.3 Rationale
Tuning ensures TabNet adapts to the dataset’s temporal and balanced nature, with `n_steps=5` aligning with the 5 time steps (Section 3.3), and `batch_size=256` balancing GPU efficiency and gradient stability.

#### 3.5.5 Training Procedure

##### 3.5.5.1 Model Initialization
Initialized `UncertaintyTabNet` with optimal parameters:
```python
model = UncertaintyTabNet(n_d=64, n_a=64, n_steps=5, gamma=1.3, lambda_sparse=1e-3, optimizer_fn=torch.optim.Adam, optimizer_params={'lr': 0.02})
```

##### 3.5.5.2 Augmentation and Training
- **Permutation**: Applied `augment_data` to \( X_{\text{train_flat}} \) before fitting.
- **Training**: Trained with Adam optimizer, 100 epochs, early stopping (patience=20) on validation loss:
  ```python
  model.fit(X_train_flat, y_train-1, X_val_flat, y_val-1, max_epochs=100, patience=20, batch_size=256)
  ```
- **Note**: Labels adjusted (\( y-1 \)) to {0, 1, 2} for PyTorch compatibility.
- **Environment**: CUDA-enabled GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4), ~15 minutes total runtime.

##### 3.5.5.3 Training Dynamics
Monitored training loss and validation accuracy, observing convergence by epoch 80, with early stopping preventing overfitting (Figure 5).

#### 3.5.6 Evaluation Metrics

##### 3.5.6.1 Outputs
- **Predictions**: \( y_{\text{pred}} = \arg\max(\mu(X)) + 1 \), mapping back to {1, 2, 3}.
- **Uncertainty**: \( \sigma(X) \) from MC Dropout, averaged across test samples (mean ~0.2292).

##### 3.5.6.2 Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification performance (96%).
- **F1-Score**: Per-class (e.g., Pathological ~0.92), emphasizing minority class detection.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true vs. predicted labels (Figure 6).
- **Mean Uncertainty**: Quantifies confidence (e.g., 0.2292), with thresholds (e.g., \( \sigma > 0.3 \)) for triage.

##### 3.5.6.3 Clinical Utility
Low uncertainty (\( \sigma < 0.2 \)) supports confident decisions (e.g., Normal delivery), while high uncertainty prompts review, enhancing trust and safety over deterministic models [5].
