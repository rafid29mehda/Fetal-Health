### 3.2 SHAP-Driven Feature Selection Using LightGBM

Feature selection is a pivotal step in optimizing machine learning models for fetal health classification, particularly given the multidimensional and potentially noisy nature of the Fetal Health Classification dataset. This subsection details the application of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [2] analysis in conjunction with LightGBM to systematically reduce the original 22 features to a clinically relevant and computationally efficient subset of 10, as implemented in `"SHAP_LightGBM.ipynb"`. By leveraging LightGBM’s robust predictive capabilities and SHAP’s interpretable feature attribution, we enhance model efficiency, reduce noise, and align the selected features with clinical indicators of fetal distress, laying a solid foundation for subsequent temporal modeling and classification.

#### 3.2.1 Rationale

##### 3.2.1.1 Problem Context
The Fetal Health Classification dataset comprises 22 features, encompassing direct physiological measurements (e.g., `fetal_movement`, `accelerations`) and histogram-derived statistics (e.g., `histogram_min`, `histogram_variance`). While this richness captures diverse aspects of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction signals, it introduces challenges: redundant features (e.g., overlap between `baseline value` and `histogram_mean`) inflate computational complexity, while clinically less impactful variables (e.g., `fetal_movement`, often negligible in distress detection [5]) contribute noise, potentially degrading model performance. Retaining all features risks overfitting, especially given the dataset’s moderate size (2,126 samples) and severe class imbalance (77.8% Normal vs. 8.3% Pathological), where irrelevant features may obscure critical distress signals.

##### 3.2.1.2 Objective
Our goal was to identify and retain the most influential features to enhance model efficiency, interpretability, and clinical relevance. Feature selection reduces dimensionality from 22 to 10, minimizing computational overhead (e.g., reducing input size from \( \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 22} \) to \( \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10} \)) and focusing the model on predictors aligned with obstetric practice, such as `abnormal_short_term_variability` and `prolongued_decelerations` [4]. This step mitigates the curse of dimensionality, improves generalization, and prepares the dataset for temporal simulation and synthetic data generation.

##### 3.2.1.3 Choice of SHAP and LightGBM
We employed SHAP, a game-theoretic approach to feature importance, due to its ability to provide consistent, interpretable, and model-agnostic explanations of feature contributions [2]. Unlike heuristic methods (e.g., correlation-based selection), SHAP quantifies each feature’s impact on individual predictions, offering a data-driven basis for selection. LightGBM, a gradient-boosting framework, was chosen as the base model for its computational efficiency, scalability with tabular data, and established performance in CTG classification (e.g., 93% accuracy in prior studies [3]). This combination ensures a robust and clinically meaningful feature subset, distinguishing our approach from prior ad-hoc feature pruning efforts [6].

#### 3.2.2 LightGBM Model Training

##### 3.2.2.1 Data Splitting
To establish a baseline model and enable SHAP analysis, the preprocessed dataset (\( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 21} \), \( y \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{2126} \)) was partitioned into training and testing sets. We used `train_test_split` from scikit-learn with a 70% training (1,488 samples) and 30% testing (638 samples) split, configured as:
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y)
```
- **Stratification**: The `stratify=y` parameter preserved the class distribution (Normal: 77.8%, Suspect: 13.9%, Pathological: 8.3%) in both subsets, ensuring representative training and evaluation.
- **Random Seed**: Setting `random_state=42` guaranteed reproducibility across experiments.

##### 3.2.2.2 Model Configuration
A LightGBM classifier (`LGBMClassifier`) was initialized with default hyperparameters optimized for tabular data:
- `num_leaves=31`: Maximum leaves per tree, balancing complexity and overfitting.
- `learning_rate=0.1`: Step size for gradient descent, ensuring stable convergence.
- `n_estimators=100`: Number of boosting rounds, sufficient for capturing feature interactions.
Training was performed on the normalized training set (\( X_{\text{train}} \in \mathbb{R}^{1488 \times 21} \)), executed as:
```python
lgb_model = LGBMClassifier(num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
lgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
The model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test set (\( X_{\text{test}} \in \mathbb{R}^{638 \times 21} \)), aligning with prior benchmarks [3] and confirming its suitability as a baseline.

##### 3.2.2.3 Purpose and Validation
The LightGBM model served as a robust foundation for SHAP analysis, leveraging its tree-based structure to efficiently handle the dataset’s tabular format and multi-class labels. Post-training, we validated its performance using accuracy and F1-scores per class (e.g., Pathological F1 ~0.85), consistent with literature [3], ensuring reliability for feature importance extraction. This step’s primary purpose was not final classification but to provide a high-performing model for SHAP computation, capitalizing on LightGBM’s speed and ability to model non-linear relationships in CTG data.

#### 3.2.3 SHAP Analysis

##### 3.2.3.1 SHAP Explainer Initialization
To quantify feature contributions, we applied the `shap.TreeExplainer`, optimized for tree-based models like LightGBM, to the trained classifier. The explainer was initialized using the training data:
```python
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(lgb_model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_train)
```
This choice leverages the explainer’s compatibility with LightGBM’s internal tree structures, ensuring computational efficiency and accuracy in SHAP value estimation.

##### 3.2.3.2 SHAP Values Calculation
SHAP values were computed for each feature across all 1,488 training samples, yielding a tensor \( \text{SHAP} \in \mathbb{R}^{1488 \times 21 \times 3} \) for the three-class problem (Normal, Suspect, Pathological). For simplicity, we aggregated across classes by taking the mean absolute SHAP value per feature per sample:
\[
\text{SHAP}_{i,j} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=1}^{3} |\text{SHAP}_{i,j,k}|
\]
where \( \text{SHAP}_{i,j,k} \) is the contribution of feature \( j \) to class \( k \) for sample \( i \). The resulting matrix \( \text{SHAP} \in \mathbb{R}^{1488 \times 21} \) captures the magnitude of each feature’s impact on predictions.

##### 3.2.3.3 Feature Importance Assessment
Feature importance was derived by computing the mean absolute SHAP value across all training samples:
\[
\text{Importance}_j = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\text{SHAP}_{i,j}|, \quad j = 1, \ldots, 21, \quad N = 1488
\]
This metric quantifies the average contribution of feature \( j \) to model predictions, normalized by sample size. Results were visualized in a bar plot (Figure 1), revealing a clear hierarchy:
- **Top Features**: `abnormal_short_term_variability` (highest importance), `histogram_variance`, and `prolongued_decelerations` exhibited the strongest influence, consistent with clinical indicators of fetal distress (e.g., variability and decelerations as per NICE guidelines [4]).
- **Low-Impact Features**: `fetal_movement`, `histogram_min`, and `histogram_number_of_zeroes` showed minimal importance (SHAP < 0.01), suggesting limited predictive value.

##### 3.2.3.4 Clinical Alignment and Insights
The SHAP analysis not only prioritized features but also provided insights into their directional impact via summary plots (not shown here but available in `"SHAP_LightGBM.ipynb"`). For instance, high `abnormal_short_term_variability` values strongly pushed predictions toward Pathological, aligning with its role as a distress marker [4]. This interpretability distinguishes SHAP from traditional importance metrics (e.g., Gini index), enhancing trust in the selection process.

#### 3.2.4 Feature Selection and Validation

##### 3.2.4.1 Selection Criteria
Based on the SHAP importance ranking, we retained the top 10 features and discarded the bottom 11 with the lowest mean absolute SHAP values:
- **Retained Features**: `abnormal_short_term_variability`, `histogram_variance`, `prolongued_decelerations`, `accelerations`, `uterine_contractions`, `histogram_mean`, `histogram_median`, `mean_value_of_short_term_variability`, `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability`, `histogram_mode`.
- **Dropped Features**: `fetal_movement`, `histogram_width`, `histogram_max`, `mean_value_of_long_term_variability`, `histogram_number_of_peaks`, `light_decelerations`, `histogram_tendency`, `histogram_number_of_zeroes`, `severe_decelerations`, `baseline value`, `histogram_min`.
This reduced the dataset to \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10} \), halving the feature space while preserving clinically significant predictors.

##### 3.2.4.2 Validation Through Retraining
To assess the impact of feature reduction, we retrained the LightGBM classifier on the reduced 10-feature dataset using the same hyperparameters and train-test split:
```python
lgb_model_reduced = LGBMClassifier(num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
lgb_model_reduced.fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)
accuracy_reduced = lgb_model_reduced.score(X_test_reduced, y_test)
```
- **Results**: Achieved 92.8% accuracy on the test set, a negligible 0.2% drop from the original 93%. F1-scores remained stable (e.g., Pathological F1 ~0.84 vs. ~0.85), confirming that the dropped features contributed minimally to predictive power.

##### 3.2.4.3 Statistical Validation
We conducted a paired t-test comparing prediction probabilities from the full (22-feature) and reduced (10-feature) models across test samples, yielding \( p > 0.05 \), indicating no significant performance degradation. Additionally, computational time decreased by approximately 40% (e.g., training time reduced from ~1.2s to ~0.7s on a standard CPU), underscoring efficiency gains.

##### 3.2.4.4 Clinical and Practical Implications
The retained features align with obstetric guidelines [4], emphasizing variability (`abnormal_short_term_variability`) and decelerations (`prolongued_decelerations`) as distress markers, while discarding less relevant features (e.g., `fetal_movement`, weakly correlated with outcomes [5]). This streamlined dataset enhances downstream temporal modeling and classification by focusing on high-impact predictors, reducing noise, and improving scalability for real-world deployment.
