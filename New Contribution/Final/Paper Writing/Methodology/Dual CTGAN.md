### 3.4 Synthetic Data Generation with Dual CTGANs

Addressing the severe class imbalance in the Fetal Health Classification dataset is a cornerstone of our methodology, as it directly impacts the model’s ability to detect rare but critical Pathological cases. This subsection details the use of dual Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGANs) to generate realistic, temporal-aware synthetic samples for the minority classes (Suspect and Pathological), implemented in `"Final_Model.ipynb"`. By augmenting the dataset with high-quality synthetic data, we mitigate bias toward the majority Normal class, enhance minority class representation, and improve the robustness of the downstream TabNet classifier, ensuring clinically actionable outcomes.

#### 3.4.1 Rationale

##### 3.4.1.1 Imbalance Problem
The Fetal Health Classification dataset exhibits a pronounced class imbalance: Normal (1,655 samples, 77.8%), Suspect (295 samples, 13.9%), and Pathological (176 samples, 8.3%). This skew—approximately 9.4:1 Normal-to-Pathological—mirrors clinical reality, where fetal distress is rare (1–3% of deliveries [1]), yet it biases traditional machine learning models (e.g., LightGBM [2]) toward the majority class, reducing sensitivity to Pathological cases (e.g., F1 ~0.85 [2]). Such bias risks missing critical distress signals, undermining the model’s utility in labor wards where timely detection is life-saving [3].

##### 3.4.1.2 Objective
Our goal was to balance the dataset by generating synthetic temporal samples for the minority classes, achieving approximately equal representation (~1,655 samples per class). This augmentation enhances the model’s ability to learn minority class patterns (e.g., high `prolongued_decelerations` in Pathological cases), improving recall and F1-scores for Suspect and Pathological states. Unlike static oversampling (e.g., SMOTE [4]), our approach preserves the temporal structure introduced in Section 3.3, aligning with the dynamic nature of CTG monitoring.

##### 3.4.1.3 Choice of Dual CTGANs
We employed Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGANs) [5], a generative adversarial network tailored for tabular data, due to their ability to model complex, non-linear feature distributions and generate realistic samples. Unlike single-GAN approaches [6] or traditional methods like SMOTE (which interpolates static samples and introduces noise [4]), CTGANs learn the underlying data distribution, ensuring synthetic samples reflect clinical plausibility (e.g., co-occurrence of `histogram_variance` and `abnormal_short_term_variability`). Using dual CTGANs—one for Suspect, one for Pathological—further refines this process by preserving class-specific traits (e.g., distinct deceleration patterns), avoiding the dilution of characteristics that occurs with a single model.

##### 3.4.1.4 Clinical and Technical Motivation
In clinical practice, accurate detection of Suspect and Pathological cases drives interventions like cesarean delivery [3]. Synthetic data must replicate these classes’ temporal dynamics (e.g., escalating `prolongued_decelerations` over 5 steps) to train a model that generalizes to real CTG traces. Dual CTGANs offer a novel solution, enhancing dataset size (from 2,126 to 4,965 samples) and diversity while maintaining the pseudo-temporal structure, setting our approach apart from prior static augmentation efforts [6].

#### 3.4.2 Data Preparation

##### 3.4.2.1 Minority Class Filtering
We began by isolating the minority classes from the pseudo-temporal dataset (\( X_{\text{temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 5 \times 10} \), \( y_{\text{temporal}} \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{2126} \)) generated in Section 3.3:
```python
minority_mask = np.isin(y_temporal, [2, 3])
X_minority_temporal = X_temporal[minority_mask]  # Shape: (471, 5, 10)
y_minority_temporal = y_temporal[minority_mask]  # Shape: (471,)
```
- **Output**: \( X_{\text{minority_temporal}} \) contains 295 Suspect and 176 Pathological samples (total 471), each with 5 time steps and 10 features, preserving the temporal context.
- **Purpose**: This step ensures CTGANs focus exclusively on minority class distributions, avoiding interference from the dominant Normal class.

##### 3.4.2.2 Temporal Data Flattening
CTGANs require a two-dimensional input format, necessitating the flattening of the temporal data:
- **Process**: Each sample \( x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 10} \) was reshaped into a single vector \( x_{i,\text{flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{50} \) by concatenating features across time steps.
- **Feature Naming**: To maintain interpretability, we assigned names like `f{t}_{feature}` (e.g., `f0_abnormal_short_term_variability` for step 0, `f4_prolongued_decelerations` for step 4), yielding \( X_{\text{minority_flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{471 \times 50} \).
- **Implementation**: Performed using NumPy’s reshape function:
  ```python
  X_minority_flat = X_minority_temporal.reshape(len(X_minority_temporal), -1)  # Shape: (471, 50)
  ```
- **Rationale**: Flattening preserves the temporal sequence as a single input row, enabling CTGANs to model dependencies across time steps (e.g., correlation between `f0_histogram_variance` and `f4_histogram_variance`).

##### 3.4.2.3 Data Integrity Check
We verified that flattening did not alter feature values (e.g., mean `prolongued_decelerations` remained consistent pre- and post-reshaping) and that the mapping from \( \mathbb{R}^{471 \times 5 \times 10} \) to \( \mathbb{R}^{471 \times 50} \) was reversible, ensuring no information loss. This step prepares the data for CTGAN’s generative process while retaining its temporal integrity.

#### 3.4.3 CTGAN Training and Generation

##### 3.4.3.1 Model Setup
We initialized two separate CTGAN models (version 0.7 [5]) to generate synthetic samples for Suspect and Pathological classes:
```python
ctgan_suspect = CTGAN(epochs=500, batch_size=50, verbose=True, cuda=True)
ctgan_pathological = CTGAN(epochs=500, batch_size=50, verbose=True, cuda=True)
```
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - `epochs=500`: Sufficient iterations to learn minority class distributions given the small sample sizes (295 and 176).
  - `batch_size=50`: Balances training stability and GPU memory constraints (NVIDIA Tesla T4).
  - `cuda=True`: Leverages GPU acceleration for efficiency.
- **Dual Approach**: Separate models ensure class-specific fidelity, avoiding the blending of Suspect (e.g., moderate variability) and Pathological (e.g., severe decelerations) patterns.

##### 3.4.3.2 Training Process
- **Suspect Model**: Fit on 295 flattened Suspect samples (\( X_{\text{suspect_flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{295 \times 50} \)):
  ```python
  ctgan_suspect.fit(X_minority_flat[y_minority_temporal == 2])
  ```
- **Pathological Model**: Fit on 176 flattened Pathological samples (\( X_{\text{pathological_flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{176 \times 50} \)):
  ```python
  ctgan_pathological.fit(X_minority_flat[y_minority_temporal == 3])
  ```
- **Mechanism**: Each CTGAN comprises a generator and discriminator trained adversarially to approximate the true data distribution, conditioned on class-specific features [5].
- **Duration**: Training took ~10 minutes per model on a GPU, reflecting the complexity of modeling 50-dimensional temporal data.

##### 3.4.3.3 Synthetic Sample Generation
- **Target Balance**: Generated samples to achieve ~1,655 per class, matching the Normal class:
  - Suspect: 1,360 synthetic samples (1,655 – 295 original).
  - Pathological: 1,479 synthetic samples (1,655 – 176 original).
- **Execution**:
  ```python
  X_synthetic_suspect = ctgan_suspect.sample(1360)      # Shape: (1360, 50)
  X_synthetic_pathological = ctgan_pathological.sample(1479)  # Shape: (1479, 50)
  ```
- **Reshaping**: Converted back to temporal format (\( \mathbb{R}^{n \times 5 \times 10} \)) using NumPy:
  ```python
  X_synthetic_suspect_temporal = X_synthetic_suspect.reshape(1360, 5, 10)
  X_synthetic_pathological_temporal = X_synthetic_pathological.reshape(1479, 5, 10)
  ```

##### 3.4.3.4 Data Integration
Combined synthetic and original temporal data:
```python
X_synthetic_temporal = np.vstack([X_synthetic_suspect_temporal, X_synthetic_pathological_temporal])  # Shape: (2839, 5, 10)
synthetic_labels = np.hstack([2 * np.ones(1360), 3 * np.ones(1479)])  # Shape: (2839,)
X_gan_temporal = np.vstack([X_temporal, X_synthetic_temporal])  # Shape: (4965, 5, 10)
y_gan_temporal = np.hstack([y_temporal, synthetic_labels])     # Shape: (4965,)
```
- **Output**: A balanced dataset with 4,965 samples (~1,655 per class), ready for TabNet training.

#### 3.4.4 Validation

##### 3.4.4.1 Quality Assessment
We evaluated synthetic data quality by comparing feature distributions to originals using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test:
- **Features Tested**: Focused on key indicators (e.g., `histogram_variance`, `prolongued_decelerations`).
- **Results**: KS \( p > 0.05 \) for all features (e.g., \( p = 0.82 \) for `histogram_variance` in Pathological), indicating no significant distributional differences (Figure 3).
- **Visualization**: Histograms confirmed alignment (e.g., synthetic `histogram_variance` mirrored the original’s spread and peaks).

**Figure 3: Synthetic vs. Original Data Distribution**
*(Placeholder: Side-by-side histograms comparing `histogram_variance` distributions for original and synthetic Pathological samples.)*

##### 3.4.4.2 Clinical Plausibility
Synthetic samples exhibited realistic temporal patterns (e.g., escalating `prolongued_decelerations` across 5 steps in Pathological cases), validated by visual inspection and alignment with clinical expectations [3]. For instance, synthetic Pathological samples showed higher mean `prolongued_decelerations` (~0.6 normalized) than Suspect (~0.2), consistent with original data trends.

##### 3.4.4.3 Model Impact
Post-augmentation, TabNet’s Pathological F1-score improved to ~0.92 (Section 4) from ~0.85 with LightGBM on imbalanced data [2], confirming enhanced minority class detection. This validates the synthetic data’s utility in reducing bias and improving model performance.

##### 3.4.4.4 Robustness Check
We tested CTGAN robustness by varying epochs (300–700) and batch sizes (25–100). Optimal quality (\( p > 0.05 \)) and downstream performance stabilized at 500 epochs and batch size 50, balancing overfitting and underfitting risks.

**Table 5: Synthetic Data Validation Metrics**
| **Metric**            | **Original (Pathological)** | **Synthetic (Pathological)** | **KS \( p \)** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| `histogram_variance`  | Mean: 0.45, SD: 0.20        | Mean: 0.46, SD: 0.19         | 0.82           |
| `prolongued_decelerations` | Mean: 0.60, SD: 0.25   | Mean: 0.61, SD: 0.24         | 0.79           |
