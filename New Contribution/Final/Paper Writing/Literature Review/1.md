### Key Points
- Research suggests our Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet framework, with 96% accuracy and 0.2252 mean uncertainty, advances fetal health classification by integrating temporal data synthesis and uncertainty quantification.
- It seems likely that our approach outperforms baseline models by addressing their limitations, such as static data reliance and lack of uncertainty measures, enhancing clinical reliability.
- The evidence leans toward our model being more clinically viable, capturing dynamic CTG patterns and providing interpretable predictions, though accuracy (96%) is slightly below some baselines (up to 99.99%).

### Dataset and Methodology
Our framework uses the UCI/Kaggle CTG dataset (2126 samples, 22 features, Normal/Suspicious/Pathological classes), synthesizing five temporal steps via CTGAN and employing an Uncertainty-Aware TabNet for classification. This contrasts with baseline models that often rely on static preprocessing like upsampling, SMOTE, or normalization, missing temporal dynamics.

### Performance and Comparison
We achieve 96% accuracy with a mean uncertainty of 0.2252, offering a balance between performance and reliability. Baselines like LightGBM (99.89%, Paper 02) and CNN (99.98–99.99%, Paper 08) show higher accuracies but lack uncertainty quantification, potentially risking overconfidence in clinical settings.

### Unexpected Detail: Clinical Trust
An unexpected benefit is our model's uncertainty score (0.2252), which flags low-confidence predictions, crucial for medical decisions where false negatives can be costly, unlike the high-accuracy but opaque baselines.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Fetal Health Classification Literature

The classification of fetal health using cardiotocography (CTG) data has evolved significantly over recent years, driven by advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. This survey note provides a comprehensive review, starting with early works using basic ML models, progressing to advanced ML and ensemble methods, deep learning approaches, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques, culminating in our proposed Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet framework. We highlight how each stage builds upon previous contributions while identifying limitations that our work addresses, ensuring a thorough understanding for a Q1 journal submission.

#### Early Works: Basic ML Models
Initial studies focused on establishing baseline performance using traditional ML algorithms on the CTG dataset, which comprises 2126 samples with 22 features classified into Normal, Suspect, and Pathological categories. Stow (2023) utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM) with oversampling, achieving 99.59% accuracy and introducing Feature Alteration for explanation of Black Box Models (FAB) for interpretability, as detailed in [Using Machine Learning to Classify Human Fetal Health and Analyze Feature Importance](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7426/3/2/19). Similarly, Rahmayanti et al. (2022) compared seven ML algorithms, identifying LightGBM as the best performer with 99% accuracy, as noted in [Comparison of machine learning algorithms to classify fetal health using cardiotocogram data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921023541). These approaches were pivotal in demonstrating ML feasibility but were limited by their inability to effectively handle class imbalance and provide comprehensive feature insights, often relying on static data representations.

#### Advanced ML and Ensemble Methods
Subsequent research advanced to more sophisticated ML techniques and ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy while addressing dataset challenges. Kuzu and Santur (2024) developed an ensemble learning model integrating Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Logistic Regression (LR), achieving over 99.5% accuracy by employing class weighting to mitigate overfitting, as discussed in [Early Diagnosis and Classification of Fetal Health Status from a Fetal Cardiotocography Dataset Using Ensemble Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/15/2471). Another ensemble approach by [IEEE Xplore authors] (year) used soft voting of multiple models, reaching 95.9% accuracy, as seen in [Fetal Health Classification Based on Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9389902). These methods enhanced performance but still treated CTG data as static, overlooking its temporal nature—a critical aspect for fetal health monitoring where patterns evolve over time, limiting their clinical applicability.

#### Deep Learning Approaches
The introduction of deep learning marked a significant leap in accuracy and model complexity, with models achieving near-perfect accuracies but often at the cost of interpretability and temporal consideration. [ScienceDirect paper] (2024) proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with Random OverSampling, achieving 99.98–99.99% accuracy, though this high performance raises concerns about overfitting, as noted in [A Framework For Classification Of Fetal Health Using Deep Learning](https://www.ijsrp.org/research-paper-0324.php?id=IJSRP.2024.15.03). Mushtaq and Veningston (2024) presented a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with SHAP for interpretability, attaining 99% accuracy, as detailed in [AI driven interpretable deep learning based fetal health classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2472630324000888), but their model did not incorporate temporal dynamics. These DL approaches demonstrated the potential of deep architectures but often lacked the interpretability and temporal modeling necessary for clinical trust and applicability.

#### Explainable AI and Interpretability
Recent works have focused on explainable AI (XAI) to enhance transparency in ML/DL models for clinical use, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning. Innab et al. (2024) utilized SHAP to provide feature importance insights in their LightGBM model with SMOTE, achieving 99.89% accuracy, as seen in [Frontiers in Public Health](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1462693/full). Similarly, [Paper 09] employed SHAP with a DNN, achieving 99% accuracy, highlighting key features like abnormal short-term variability. TabNet, used in Regmi (2023) and [Paper 10], offered inherent interpretability through attention mechanisms, with accuracies of 94.36% and 94% (avg), respectively, as noted in [Classification Methods Based on Machine Learning for the Analysis of Fetal Health Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10962) and [Optuna and TabNet Approach to Fetal Health Classification](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385614614_Optuna_and_TabNet_Approach_to_Fetal_Health_Classification). However, these models still operated on static data representations, missing the opportunity to capture temporal patterns crucial for accurate fetal health assessment, thus limiting their clinical utility.

#### Our Work: Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet
Building upon these advancements, our proposed Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet framework integrates temporal data synthesis, attention-based classification, and uncertainty quantification, addressing the limitations of prior works. By generating synthetic temporal sequences with CTGAN and employing an Uncertainty-Aware TabNet, our model achieves 96% accuracy with a mean uncertainty of 0.2252, providing not only high performance but also reliable confidence measures for clinical decision-making. This approach captures dynamic patterns in CTG data, unlike static models, and quantifies uncertainty, a feature absent in all baselines, enhancing clinical trust. Our framework represents a comprehensive solution, aligning with the needs of real-time CTG monitoring and offering a balanced trade-off between performance and reliability, as validated against the UCI/Kaggle CTG dataset.
