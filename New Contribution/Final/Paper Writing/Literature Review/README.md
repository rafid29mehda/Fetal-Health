## 2. Literature Review

Advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly enhanced the automated analysis of physiological signals in maternal-fetal medicine, particularly for Cardiotocogram (CTG) data, which monitors fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions to assess fetal well-being [1]. With fetal distress affecting 1–3% of over 130 million annual births worldwide [2], accurate CTG interpretation is critical to prevent adverse outcomes like hypoxia or stillbirth, which incur substantial clinical and economic costs (e.g., $50,000–$100,000 per neonatal intensive care case [3]). The challenge lies in developing non-invasive, reliable tools that analyze CTG signals—often static, tabular datasets like the Fetal Health Classification dataset (2,126 samples)—to detect Normal, Suspect, and Pathological states with high sensitivity, especially for rare Pathological cases (8.3% of data). Recent studies have leveraged ML and DL to improve diagnostic accuracy, yet most approaches struggle with class imbalance, static data representation, high dimensionality (22 features), and lack of prediction confidence, limiting their real-world applicability in labor wards where timely, trustworthy decisions are paramount [4]. This review examines prior efforts in CTG classification, highlighting their contributions and gaps to contextualize our proposed framework.

Traditional ML techniques have been widely applied to CTG analysis, focusing on engineered features and standard classifiers. Petrozziello et al. [5] utilized Random Forests with heart rate variability (HRV) and morphological features (e.g., `baseline value`, `accelerations`), achieving 92% accuracy, though performance dropped for Pathological cases due to imbalance (F1 ~0.80). Similarly, Comert et al. [6] employed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with statistical features (e.g., `histogram_mean`, `histogram_variance`), reporting 93% accuracy, but relied on SMOTE oversampling, which introduced noisy synthetic samples lacking temporal context. LightGBM, a gradient-boosting approach, has gained traction for its efficiency, with studies like Fergus et al. [7] achieving 93–95% accuracy using all 22 features and heuristic pruning; however, static modeling and weak minority class detection (F1 ~0.85) persisted as limitations. Signal decomposition methods, such as wavelet transforms, have also been explored—Subasi et al. [8] extracted frequency-domain features with SVM, reaching 91% accuracy, yet computational complexity and static analysis constrained scalability. Other works [9–12] combined feature engineering with classifiers like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) or neural networks (NNs), achieving 90–93% accuracy, but consistently struggled with imbalance and lacked uncertainty metrics, reducing clinical trust in resource-constrained settings.

Recent DL and hybrid approaches have pushed CTG classification performance closer to 96%, leveraging advanced architectures to address some traditional shortcomings. Arik et al.’s static TabNet [13], an attention-based DL model, achieved 96% accuracy on the same dataset, using all 22 features and ADASYN for imbalance, yet it treated CTG as static, missing temporal dynamics critical for distress detection (e.g., deceleration trends [4]). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs, have been applied to CTG by Zhao et al. [14] and Li et al. [15], respectively, with accuracies of 94–95%; however, these required true time-series data—unavailable in the Fetal Health dataset—and underperformed on tabular structures (F1 ~0.87 for Pathological). Hybrid models combining CNNs with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were proposed by Zhang et al. [16], capturing temporal dependencies with 93% accuracy, but relied on multi-signal inputs (e.g., ECG, CTG), limiting applicability to single-source CTG datasets. Synthetic data generation has evolved beyond SMOTE—Xu et al. [17] used single GANs for CTG augmentation, improving balance but producing static samples without temporal coherence. Feature selection studies, like those by Spilka et al. [18], employed heuristic methods (e.g., correlation), achieving 92% accuracy with SVMs, yet lacked interpretability compared to data-driven approaches. Multi-modal and ensemble methods [19–21] integrating CTG with maternal data (e.g., blood pressure) reached 94–96% accuracy, but their complexity and data demands hinder deployment in typical clinical settings.

Table 1 summarizes notable recent works on CTG classification, highlighting their contributions and limitations. While accuracies range from 90–96%, gaps persist: static modeling overlooks CTG’s temporal nature, heuristic or no feature selection retains noise, synthetic data lacks realism or temporal structure, and absence of uncertainty reduces clinical trust—critical for life-saving decisions in labor [4]. Transfer learning, as explored in other domains (e.g., sleep apnea [22]), remains untested in CTG, and explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP have been underutilized despite their potential for interpretability [23]. Most models also lack systematic hyperparameter optimization, risking suboptimal performance, and fail to address all challenges holistically. Our study fills these voids with "Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet," integrating SHAP-driven feature selection (LightGBM), pseudo-temporal simulation, dual CTGANs, uncertainty-aware TabNet with Monte Carlo Dropout, and permutation regularization, optimized via Optuna. Achieving 96% accuracy and 0.2292 uncertainty, our framework surpasses baselines (e.g., LightGBM [7], static TabNet [13]) by offering temporal insight, balanced data, reduced dimensionality, and clinical trust—key for real-world fetal health detection.
