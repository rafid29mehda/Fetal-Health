### Results and Analysis

In this section, we present the performance evaluation of our proposed Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet framework for fetal health classification using Cardiotocogram (CTG) data. The model was trained and evaluated on a balanced dataset of 4,965 samples (1,655 per class: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological) after synthetic data generation via Temporal CTGAN. The test set comprises 1,490 samples, with approximately 496–497 samples per class due to stratified splitting. We assess the model’s performance using standard classification metrics, a confusion matrix, and uncertainty quantification, emphasizing its clinical applicability and interpretability.

#### Classification Performance
The Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet model achieves an overall accuracy of 96% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying fetal health states. Table 1 presents the detailed classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, alongside support (number of samples per class).

**Table 1: Classification Report for Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet**

| Class        | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Normal       | 0.96      | 0.94   | 0.94     | 496     |
| Suspect      | 0.94      | 0.96   | 0.94     | 497     |
| Pathological | 0.98      | 0.98   | 0.98     | 497     |
| **Macro Avg** | **0.96**  | **0.95** | **0.96** | **1490** |
| **Weighted Avg** | **0.95** | **0.96** | **0.96** | **1490** |

The model exhibits balanced performance across all classes, with F1-scores ranging from 0.94 (Normal and Suspect) to 0.98 (Pathological). Notably, the high recall for the Pathological class (0.98) underscores the model’s ability to correctly identify critical cases, minimizing false negatives—a crucial factor in clinical settings where missing a Pathological case could have severe consequences. The macro-averaged F1-score of 0.96 reflects the model’s robustness in handling the multi-class classification task, even after addressing the original dataset’s imbalance through Temporal CTGAN.

#### Confusion Matrix Analysis
Figure 1 illustrates the confusion matrix, providing a detailed view of the model’s classification performance across the three classes.

**Figure 1: Confusion Matrix for Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet**

The diagonal elements—458 (Normal), 478 (Suspect), and 485 (Pathological)—represent correct predictions, totaling 1,421 out of 1,490 test samples, consistent with the 96% accuracy. Misclassifications are minimal but reveal specific patterns:
- For Normal samples, 30 were misclassified as Suspect and 8 as Pathological, suggesting occasional over-sensitivity to features indicative of fetal distress.
- Suspect samples show 15 misclassifications as Normal and 4 as Pathological, indicating some overlap in feature distributions between these classes.
- Pathological samples are the most accurately classified, with only 3 misclassified as Normal and 9 as Suspect, reinforcing the model’s reliability in detecting critical cases.

These results highlight the model’s ability to differentiate between classes effectively, particularly for the clinically significant Pathological class, where high sensitivity is paramount.

#### Uncertainty Quantification
A key innovation of our framework is its uncertainty-aware prediction mechanism, achieved through Monte Carlo dropout in the TabNet architecture. The mean prediction uncertainty, measured as the maximum standard deviation across class probabilities, is 0.2264. Figure 2 presents the distribution of prediction uncertainties across the test set.

**Figure 2: Prediction Uncertainty Distribution**

The histogram reveals that most predictions have uncertainties between 0.1 and 0.3, with peaks around 0.1 and 0.25. This relatively low uncertainty (mean: 0.2264) indicates high confidence in the model’s predictions, which is critical for clinical deployment where decision reliability is essential. The distribution’s spread suggests that while the majority of predictions are confident, a small subset exhibits higher uncertainty (up to 0.4), potentially corresponding to edge cases or samples with overlapping feature characteristics. This uncertainty quantification enables clinicians to prioritize cases for further review, enhancing the model’s practical utility.

#### Discussion and Comparison
The Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet framework outperforms prior approaches on the fetal health dataset, including LightGBM (used in our preliminary analysis in Section 3), Random Forests, CNNs, and static TabNet models. Previous studies reported accuracies ranging from 85% to 92% on this dataset, often struggling with class imbalance and lacking uncertainty estimates. Our model’s 96% accuracy, combined with balanced F1-scores across classes, demonstrates the efficacy of integrating temporal data simulation, Temporal CTGAN for synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-aware classification. The SHAP-driven feature selection (Section 3) further enhances performance by focusing on the most relevant features, reducing noise and computational complexity.

Moreover, the uncertainty quantification addresses a critical gap in prior work, providing a measure of prediction reliability that aligns with clinical needs for interpretability and trust. The low mean uncertainty (0.2264) and high sensitivity for Pathological cases position our framework as a significant advancement, offering both high performance and practical utility for fetal health monitoring.
