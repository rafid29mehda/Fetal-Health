Including an algorithm in the methodology section is an excellent way to meet Q1 journal expectations, as it provides a concise, structured summary of our approach, enhancing readability and technical rigor. Below, I’ve crafted a pseudo-code algorithm that encapsulates our "Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet" framework, integrating the five methodology steps (3.1–3.5). This algorithm is designed to be clear, impactful, and aligned with your work from `SHAP_LightGBM.ipynb` and `Final Model.ipynb`. I’ll present it in a format typical of Q1 papers, followed by an explanation of its placement and styling.

### Algorithm for Methodology Section

#### Algorithm 1: Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet Framework for Fetal Health Classification
```plaintext
Input: Fetal Health Dataset D (2126 samples, 21 features, fetal_health labels {1, 2, 3})
Output: Trained Model M, Predictions P, Uncertainty U

1. // Dataset and Preprocessing (Section 3.1)
2. Load D ← fetal_health.csv
3. Perform EDA: Visualize class distribution of fetal_health
4. Split D into X (features), y (labels)
5. Phase 1: Scale X with StandardScaler for SHAP analysis
6. Phase 2: Scale X with MinMaxScaler to [0, 1] for TabNet
7. Split X, y into X_train (70%), X_test (30%), stratified by y
8. Further split X_train into X_train_final (80%), X_valid (20%), stratified

9. // SHAP-Driven Feature Selection (Section 3.2)
10. Train LightGBM on SMOTE-balanced X_train, y_train
11. Compute SHAP values S for X_test
12. Rank features by Pathological_mean_abs_SHAP
13. Drop low-impact features F_drop ← {fetal_movement, histogram_width, ...} (11 features)
14. Update X ← X \ F_drop (10 features remain)

15. // Pseudo-Temporal Data Simulation (Section 3.4)
16. For each sample x_i in X:
17.     Initialize temporal sequence T_i ← empty
18.     For t ← 1 to 5:
19.         Add noise n ← Uniform(-0.05, 0.05) to x_i
20.         Clip x_i + n to [0, 1]
21.         Append to T_i
22.     X_temporal ← X_temporal ∪ T_i
23. Assign y_temporal ← y

24. // Synthetic Data Generation with Dual CTGAN (Section 3.3)
25. Filter X_temporal_minority, y_temporal_minority where y ∈ {2, 3}
26. Flatten X_temporal_minority to X_flat (n_samples × 50)
27. Train CTGAN_Suspect on Suspect data (y = 2), epochs = 500
28. Train CTGAN_Pathological on Pathological data (y = 3), epochs = 500
29. Generate synthetic samples: 1360 Suspect, 1479 Pathological
30. Reshape synthetic data to X_synthetic_temporal (n_samples × 5 × 10)
31. Combine X_gan_temporal ← X_temporal ∪ X_synthetic_temporal
32. Combine y_gan_temporal ← y_temporal ∪ synthetic_labels

33. // Uncertainty-Aware TabNet with Permutation Regularization (Section 3.5)
34. Flatten X_gan_temporal to X_flat (n_samples × 50)
35. Define UncertaintyTabNet M with dropout p = 0.3
36. Optimize hyperparameters H via Optuna (n_d, n_a, n_steps, gamma, lambda_sparse, lr)
37. Augment X_train_flat ← Permute features with probability 0.1
38. Train M on X_train_flat, y_train_final with H, max_epochs = 100, patience = 20
39. For each x_test in X_test_flat:
40.     Compute P_mean, P_std over 50 dropout-enabled forward passes
41.     P ← argmax(P_mean) + 1
42.     U ← max(P_std)
43. Return M, P, U
```

### Explanation and Styling

#### Why Include This?
- **Q1 Standard**: Many Q1 papers (e.g., in IEEE Transactions or Medical Informatics) use algorithms to distill complex methodologies into a single, scannable block, appealing to technical readers.
- **Clarity**: It ties together your five steps (3.1–3.5), showing how data flows from raw input to predictions with uncertainty.
- **Novelty**: Highlights unique elements like dual CTGAN, temporal simulation, and uncertainty quantification, distinguishing your work from baselines.

#### Structure
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Clearly defined to frame the problem and solution.
- **Steps**: Organized by methodology sections, with comments linking to 3.1–3.5. Note that 3.4 (temporal simulation) precedes 3.3 (CTGAN) in execution order, as your code simulates temporal data before generating synthetic samples.
- **Pseudo-Code Style**: Uses a mix of natural language and programming constructs (e.g., loops, assignments), common in Q1 papers for accessibility.

#### Placement in Paper
- **Where**: Insert at the end of the "Methodology" section, after 3.5, titled "Algorithm 1: Temporal CTGAN + Uncertainty-Aware TabNet Framework for Fetal Health Classification."
- **Caption**: Add a brief caption, e.g., "Algorithm 1 summarizes the proposed framework, integrating SHAP-driven feature selection, pseudo-temporal simulation, dual CTGAN synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-aware TabNet training."
- **Formatting**: Use a single-column box or float environment in LaTeX (e.g., `\begin{algorithm}` with `algorithmic` package) to ensure it stands out. Number lines for reference in the text.

#### Word Count Impact
- The algorithm itself isn’t counted in section word limits (200–350 words each), as it’s a standalone element. Reference it in each subsection (e.g., "See Algorithm 1, lines 9–14" in 3.2) to connect it to the narrative without inflating prose.

### Integration with Visuals
Pair this with your recommended visuals (from the previous response):
- **Figure 1**: Class distribution ties to lines 3 and 29–31.
- **Figure 2, Table 1**: SHAP analysis from lines 11–14.
- **Diagram 1**: Mirrors the full algorithm flow.
- **Figure 3, Table 2**: Results from lines 39–42.
- **Figure 4**: Uncertainty from line 42.
