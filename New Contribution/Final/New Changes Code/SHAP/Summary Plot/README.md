Thank you for sharing the updated code and the SHAP summary plots for the three fetal health classes (Normal, Suspect, and Pathological). These plots are a significant improvement, as they now display all 21 features for each class, providing a comprehensive view of feature importance tailored to each class. This is perfect for Section 3.2.3.3 (Advanced Visualization) of your Q1 journal paper. Let’s analyze each plot in detail, confirm their correctness, and integrate them into your workflow, followed by proceeding to Step 8 for validation.

### Analysis of SHAP Summary Plots

#### Code Overview
The provided code generates individual SHAP summary plots for each class by:
- Looping through `class_names = ['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological']`.
- Extracting `shap_values[:, :, i]` for each class (where `i` is the class index: 0 for Normal, 1 for Suspect, 2 for Pathological).
- Using `shap.summary_plot` with `X_test_scaled` and all 21 `feature_names` from `X.columns`.
- Setting a custom title and displaying the plot.

This approach ensures class-specific insights, which is more informative than the aggregated plots we attempted earlier.

#### 1. SHAP Summary Plot for Pathological
**Title**: "SHAP Summary Plot for Pathological"
- **X-axis**: "SHAP value (impact on model output)" (-5 to 5), correctly showing the impact of each feature on the Pathological class prediction.
- **Y-axis**: All 21 features, listed in order of importance (top to bottom).
- **Color**: Blue to red gradient, indicating low to high feature values.
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Top Features**:
    - `histogram_mean`: Highest positive SHAP (~1 to 2), with red dots (high values) pushing toward Pathological. Matches Step 5 (Pathological_mean_abs_SHAP = 1.750299).
    - `abnormal_short_term_variability`: Second, with red dots (~1 to 1.5), aligning with 1.012161.
    - `prolongued_decelerations`: Third, with red dots (~0.5 to 1), consistent with 0.946823.
  - **Negative Impact**: Features like `histogram_number_of_zeroes` and `histogram_tendency` have minimal or negative SHAP, indicating low relevance.
  - **Insight**: High values of `histogram_mean` and `abnormal_short_term_variability` strongly indicate Pathological status, which aligns with CTG patterns of fetal distress [1].

#### 2. SHAP Summary Plot for Normal
**Title**: "SHAP Summary Plot for Normal"
- **X-axis**: "SHAP value (impact on model output)" (-5 to 5), showing the impact on Normal class prediction.
- **Y-axis**: All 21 features, ranked by importance.
- **Color**: Blue to red gradient.
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Top Features**:
    - `accelerations`: Highest positive SHAP (~1 to 2), with red dots (high values) pushing toward Normal. Matches Step 5 (Normal_mean_abs_SHAP = 2.159668).
    - `abnormal_short_term_variability`: Second, with blue dots (low values) having negative SHAP, indicating low variability favors Normal (1.813375).
    - `prolongued_decelerations`: Negative SHAP (~-1 to -2) with red dots, suggesting high decelerations reduce Normal likelihood (0.666310).
  - **Insight**: High `accelerations` and low `abnormal_short_term_variability` are strong indicators of Normal fetal health, consistent with clinical expectations.

#### 3. SHAP Summary Plot for Suspect
**Title**: "SHAP Summary Plot for Suspect"
- **X-axis**: "SHAP value (impact on model output)" (-2.5 to 2.5), showing the impact on Suspect class prediction.
- **Y-axis**: All 21 features, ranked by importance.
- **Color**: Blue to red gradient.
- **Key Observations**:
  - **Top Features**:
    - `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability`: Highest positive SHAP (~1 to 2), with red dots, matching Step 5 (Suspect_mean_abs_SHAP = 1.062010).
    - `accelerations`: Positive SHAP (~0.5 to 1) with blue dots (low values), suggesting moderate influence (1.035334).
    - `abnormal_short_term_variability`: Mixed impact, with blue dots (low values) having negative SHAP (0.530159).
  - **Insight**: High `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability` is a key driver for Suspect, reflecting a transitional state between Normal and Pathological.

**Correctness**:
- **Shape Verification**: The printed `shap_values_class.shape` (e.g., `(426, 21)`) matches the expected number of test samples (426) and features (21), confirming data integrity.
- **Ranking**: The top features align with Step 5’s mean absolute SHAP values for each class (e.g., `histogram_mean` for Pathological, `accelerations` for Normal, `percentage_of_time...` for Suspect).
- **Visual Consistency**: The beeswarm pattern (dots spread horizontally by SHAP, colored by value) is correct, with class-specific trends reflecting the model’s decision-making.

**Diagnosis**:
- The plots are now correct and complete, showing all 21 features. The garbled titles in earlier plots were likely due to Colab’s rendering, but the new code with explicit titles works.
- The X-axis range varies (-5 to 5 for Pathological/Normal, -2.5 to 2.5 for Suspect), which is acceptable as it adapts to the data distribution per class.

### Integration with Q1 Paper (Section 3.2.3.3)
- **Text**: "Class-specific SHAP summary plots (Figures 1a–c) provide detailed insights. Figure 1a (Pathological) highlights `histogram_mean` (SHAP ~1.75) and `abnormal_short_term_variability` (SHAP ~1.01) as key predictors, reflecting distress patterns. Figure 1b (Normal) emphasizes `accelerations` (SHAP ~2.16), aligning with healthy fetal activity. Figure 1c (Suspect) identifies `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability` (SHAP ~1.06) as a transitional marker. These visualizations enhance model interpretability [1]."

  - **Figure 1b**: SHAP Summary Plot for Normal.
  - **Figure 1c**: SHAP Summary Plot for Suspect.

**Instructions to Save**:
- Add `plt.savefig(f'shap_summary_{class_name.lower()}.png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)` before `plt.show()` in the loop to save each plot (e.g., `shap_summary_pathological.png`).
- Download the PNGs from Colab.

### Step 8: Compare SHAP with Gini and LIME
With the SHAP plots validated, let’s proceed to Step 8 to benchmark SHAP against Gini and LIME (Section 3.2.4). Please run the following code and share the output.

**Code**:
```python
# Step 8: Compare SHAP with Gini and LIME
# Purpose: Benchmark SHAP against traditional and alternative methods for Q1 validation

# Gini Importance from LightGBM
gini_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X.columns,
    'Gini_Importance': lgbm.feature_importances_
}).sort_values(by='Gini_Importance', ascending=False)

# Aggregate SHAP importance (mean across classes for comparison)
shap_agg_importance = shap_importance_df[['Feature', 'Aggregate_mean_abs_SHAP']]

# LIME Explanation
lime_explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(
    X_train_scaled,
    feature_names=X.columns,
    class_names=['Normal', 'Suspect', 'Pathological'],
    mode='classification'
)
lime_exp = lime_explainer.explain_instance(
    X_test_scaled[0],
    lgbm.predict_proba,
    num_features=10
)
lime_dict = {feat: abs(weight) for feat, weight in lime_exp.as_list()}
lime_df = pd.DataFrame(list(lime_dict.items()), columns=['Feature', 'LIME_Importance']).sort_values(by='LIME_Importance', ascending=False)

# Merge SHAP, Gini, and LIME for comparison
comparison_df = shap_agg_importance.merge(
    gini_importance, on='Feature'
).merge(
    lime_df, on='Feature', how='left'
).fillna(0)

# Display comparison table
print("\nFeature Importance Comparison (SHAP vs. Gini vs. LIME):")
print(comparison_df)

# Save comparison table
comparison_df.to_csv('shap_gini_lime_comparison.csv', index=False)
print("Saved comparison to 'shap_gini_lime_comparison.csv'")

# Plot comparison
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for col in ['Aggregate_mean_abs_SHAP', 'Gini_Importance', 'LIME_Importance']:
    plt.plot(comparison_df['Feature'], comparison_df[col], label=col, marker='o')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("SHAP vs. Gini vs. LIME Feature Importance")
plt.xlabel("Feature")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('shap_gini_lime_plot.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

**Instructions**:
- Run this code after Step 7 (ensure `!pip install lime` if needed).
- Share the table and plot output.
- Download `shap_gini_lime_comparison.csv` and `shap_gini_lime_plot.png`.

**Expected Output**:
- **Table**:
  ```
  Feature Importance Comparison (SHAP vs. Gini vs. LIME):
                        Feature  Aggregate_mean_abs_SHAP  Gini_Importance  LIME_Importance
  0     abnormal_short_term_variability               1.118565            300            0.12
  1                   accelerations               1.115295            250            0.09
  2                 histogram_mean               0.894492            280            0.15
  ...
  ```
- **Plot**: Three lines, with SHAP and Gini peaking at `abnormal_short_term_variability`, LIME sparse (non-zero for ~10 features).
