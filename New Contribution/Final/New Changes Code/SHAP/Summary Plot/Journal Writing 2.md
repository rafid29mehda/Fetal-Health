### 3.2.3.3 Advanced Visualization
To gain deeper insights into the predictive behavior of the LightGBM model for fetal health classification, advanced SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations were utilized to dissect feature contributions across classes. SHAP summary plots were generated for each fetal health class—Normal, Suspect, and Pathological—using the test dataset (426 samples) and the complete set of 21 features extracted from cardiotocogram (CTG) data. These plots, depicted in Figures 1a–c, illustrate the directional impact of each feature on the model’s predictions, enhancing interpretability for clinical applications.

**Figure 1a: SHAP Summary Plot for Pathological** highlights the key features influencing the identification of pathological fetal conditions. The feature `histogram_mean` emerges as the most significant, with SHAP values spanning from 0 to 5, where high values (red) markedly increase the probability of a Pathological prediction. Following closely, `abnormal_short_term_variability` (SHAP values ~1 to 4) and `prolongued_decelerations` (SHAP values ~0 to 3) also exhibit strong positive impacts when their values are elevated (red). In contrast, features such as `histogram_number_of_zeroes` and `histogram_tendency` show SHAP values near zero or slightly negative, indicating their limited role in predicting Pathological outcomes. These results are consistent with clinical knowledge, where elevated mean fetal heart rate (FHR) and abnormal variability are critical indicators of fetal distress.

**Figure 1b: SHAP Summary Plot for Normal** reveals the features most associated with healthy fetal states. The feature `accelerations` stands out as the leading contributor, with SHAP values ranging from 0 to 5, where high values (red) strongly favor a Normal classification. This aligns with the physiological role of accelerations as a marker of fetal well-being. Additionally, `abnormal_short_term_variability` shows a negative impact when its values are high (red), with SHAP values around -2 to 0, suggesting that increased variability reduces the likelihood of a Normal prediction. Similarly, `prolongued_decelerations` display negative SHAP values (approximately -3 to 0) with high values (red), reinforcing their adverse effect on Normal classification. This pattern supports clinical understanding that frequent accelerations and minimal decelerations are hallmarks of a healthy fetus.

**Figure 1c: SHAP Summary Plot for Suspect** elucidates the feature influences for the intermediate Suspect class. The feature `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability` exerts the greatest impact, with SHAP values ranging from 0 to 2.5, where high values (red) significantly drive Suspect predictions. This reflects the role of long-term variability anomalies in signaling potential fetal compromise. The feature `accelerations` shows a moderate positive effect (SHAP ~0 to 1.5) with low values (blue), while `abnormal_short_term_variability` exhibits a balanced impact, with SHAP values distributed between -2 and 2. Features like `prolongued_decelerations` and `histogram_tendency` have minimal influence, with SHAP values clustering around zero, indicating their secondary role in Suspect classification. The constrained SHAP range (-2.5 to 2.5) underscores the transitional nature of the Suspect class, bridging Normal and Pathological states.

The SHAP summary plots offer a detailed perspective on how features contribute to the model’s decisions across different fetal health classes, validating its predictive rationale. The prominence of features such as `histogram_mean` and `abnormal_short_term_variability` in Pathological predictions, `accelerations` in Normal predictions, and `percentage_of_time_with_abnormal_long_term_variability` in Suspect predictions aligns with established CTG diagnostic criteria [1]. These visualizations bridge the gap between machine learning outputs and clinical interpretations, fostering trust and facilitating potential deployment in fetal health monitoring systems.

  - Figure 1a: SHAP Summary Plot for Pathological class, illustrating feature impact on model output.
  - Figure 1b: SHAP Summary Plot for Normal class, highlighting key predictors of healthy fetal states.
  - Figure 1c: SHAP Summary Plot for Suspect class, showing transitional feature influences.
- **Saving Plots**: Use the code modification suggested earlier (`plt.savefig(f'shap_summary_{class_name.lower()}.png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)`) to save the plots for inclusion in your paper.
