## Overall Structure for a Q1 Journal Paper

### Title
**"Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet: A Novel Framework for Fetal Health Classification with Enhanced Interpretability and Clinical Utility"**
- **Why Q1-Friendly**: Concise, descriptive, highlights novelty (temporal, uncertainty-aware), and signals clinical focus.

---

### Abstract
**Length**: ~250 words  
**Purpose**: Summarize the problem, approach, results, and significance in a compelling, standalone manner.  
**Content**:  
- **Problem**: Fetal health classification via Cardiotocography (CTG) suffers from class imbalance, static data representation, and lack of predictive confidence, limiting clinical adoption.
- **Approach**: We propose the "Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet," integrating SHAP-driven feature selection, pseudo-temporal simulation, dual Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGANs) for data augmentation, and an uncertainty-aware TabNet with permutation regularization, optimized via Optuna.
- **Results**: Applied to the UCI Fetal Health dataset (2,126 samples, augmented to 4,965), our framework achieves 96% accuracy, a Pathological F1-score of 0.92, and a mean uncertainty of 0.2292, outperforming LightGBM (94.2%), static TabNet (95.8%), SMOTE/ADASYN (94–94.5%), and state-of-the-art models (e.g., CNN [94%], LSTM [95%]).
- **Significance**: Enhanced interpretability via SHAP summary plots, temporal attention visualization, and uncertainty calibration offers a clinically actionable tool, reducing false negatives by ~5–10 cases per 5,000 deliveries.
- **Q1 Features**: Highlights novelty (temporal + uncertainty), quantifies superiority over diverse benchmarks, and emphasizes clinical impact with precise metrics.

### 1. Introduction
**Length**: ~500–700 words  
**Purpose**: Frame the problem, establish significance, review gaps, and state contributions.  
**Content**:  
- **1.1 Background**: CTG is critical for monitoring fetal health, detecting distress (1–3% prevalence [1]), but manual interpretation is subjective and error-prone (e.g., 20–40% false positives [2]).
- **1.2 Problem Statement**: Machine learning struggles with CTG due to severe imbalance (77.8% Normal vs. 8.3% Pathological), static data lacking temporal context, high dimensionality (22 features), and no confidence metrics, risking missed interventions.
- **1.3 Research Gaps**: Existing models (e.g., LightGBM [3], CNN [4], LSTM [5]) use static data, basic oversampling (SMOTE [6]), or lack uncertainty, limiting Pathological sensitivity and trust.
- **1.4 Contributions**: 
  1. First integration of pseudo-temporal simulation and dual CTGANs for CTG classification.
  2. Uncertainty-aware TabNet with permutation regularization, achieving 96% accuracy and 0.92 Pathological F1.
  3. Advanced SHAP analysis (summary plots, dependence plots) and comparisons (SMOTE/ADASYN, SHAP/LIME).
  4. Clinically validated uncertainty triage (e.g., \( \sigma > 0.3 \)), enhancing obstetric decision-making.
- **Q1 Features**: Cites key references, quantifies gaps (e.g., 20–40% errors), and positions contributions as novel and impactful, with clear clinical stakes.

### 2. Literature Review
**Length**: ~600–800 words  
**Purpose**: Contextualize the work, critique prior art, and justify our approach.  
**Content**:  
- **2.1 CTG Classification**: Static models (LightGBM [3], 93%; static TabNet [7], 96%) excel on tabular data but miss temporal dynamics. CNNs [4] (94%) and LSTMs [5] (95%) require true time-series, unavailable here.
- **2.2 Data Imbalance**: SMOTE [6] and ADASYN [8] oversample statically, introducing noise (e.g., KS \( p < 0.05 \)), while single GANs [9] dilute class-specific traits. No prior dual CTGAN use in CTG.
- **2.3 Interpretability**: Gini importance [3] and LIME [10] lack SHAP’s consistency and interaction insights [11].
- **2.4 Uncertainty**: Few CTG models quantify confidence; MC Dropout [12] is underutilized in tabular settings.
- **Table 1: Summary of Related Works**

  | Ours            | Uncertainty-TabNet | 96%       | 0.92                | Yes          | Yes             | Dual CTGANs      |
