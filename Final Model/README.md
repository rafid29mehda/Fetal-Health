## 3. Materials and Methods

This section delineates the comprehensive methodology employed to develop and evaluate our "Temporal Uncertainty-Aware TabNet" framework for fetal health classification using Cardiotocogram (CTG) data. Our approach integrates two distinct phases: (1) SHAP-driven feature selection using LightGBM, as implemented in `"SHAP_LightGBM.ipynb"`, to reduce dimensionality and enhance interpretability, and (2) a novel pipeline from `"Final_Model.ipynb"` that simulates pseudo-temporal data, generates synthetic minority class samples with dual Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGAN), and trains an uncertainty-aware TabNet classifier with permutation regularization. Achieving 96% accuracy and a mean uncertainty of 0.2292, this methodology addresses critical challenges in CTG analysis: high dimensionality, class imbalance, static data representation, and lack of prediction confidence. Below, we detail each step, providing technical rigor, justifications, and implementation specifics to ensure reproducibility and scientific validity.

### 3.1 Dataset Description

#### 3.1.1 Source and Composition
We utilized the publicly available Fetal Health Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [10], comprising 2,126 CTG samples collected by Ayres-de-Campos et al. Each sample includes 22 features derived from fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction signals, alongside an expert-assigned label categorizing fetal health into three classes: Normal (1,655 samples, 77.8%), Suspect (295 samples, 13.9%), and Pathological (176 samples, 8.3%). These labels, encoded as integers (1: Normal, 2: Suspect, 3: Pathological), reflect clinical assessments of fetal well-being, making the dataset a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models in maternal-fetal medicine.

#### 3.1.2 Feature Overview
The original dataset contains 22 features, including direct measurements (e.g., `baseline value`, `fetal_movement`) and statistical descriptors from FHR histograms (e.g., `histogram_mean`, `histogram_variance`). These features capture diverse aspects of fetal physiology, but their high dimensionality and varying relevance pose challenges for model efficiency and interpretability. Table 2 lists the original features, which we subsequently refine using SHAP analysis.

#### 3.1.3 Rationale for Dataset Selection
The dataset’s clinical origin, moderate size, and severe imbalance make it an ideal testbed for addressing real-world challenges in fetal health monitoring. Its imbalance mirrors clinical scenarios where Pathological cases are rare but critical, necessitating robust minority class handling—a key focus of our methodology.

### 3.2 SHAP-Driven Feature Selection with LightGBM

#### 3.2.1 Motivation
The original 22 features include potentially redundant or clinically less impactful variables (e.g., `fetal_movement`, `histogram_min`), increasing computational complexity and noise in downstream models. Prior approaches often retained all features [1] or used heuristic pruning [3], lacking interpretability. We employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [6] with LightGBM to systematically identify and drop low-importance features, enhancing model efficiency and clinical relevance.

#### 3.2.2 LightGBM Implementation
We implemented this step in `"SHAP_LightGBM.ipynb"`:
- **Library Imports**: Imported `pandas`, `numpy`, `lightgbm`, `sklearn`, and `shap` in a Python 3.11 environment on Google Colab.
- **Data Loading**: Loaded `fetal_health.csv` into a DataFrame (`data`), with features in \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 21} \) and labels in \( y \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{2126} \).
- **Preprocessing**: Applied `MinMaxScaler` to scale features to [0, 1], ensuring compatibility with LightGBM’s gradient boosting framework.
- **Train-Test Split**: Split data into 70% training (1,488 samples) and 30% testing (638 samples) sets using `train_test_split` with `random_state=42` and `stratify=y` to preserve class distribution.
- **Model Training**: Trained a LightGBM classifier (`LGBMClassifier`) with default parameters (e.g., `num_leaves=31`, `learning_rate=0.1`, 100 boosting rounds). The model achieved 93% accuracy on the test set, consistent with prior reports [1].

#### 3.2.3 SHAP Analysis
- **SHAP Explainer**: Used `shap.TreeExplainer` tailored for tree-based models like LightGBM, applied to the trained model and training data.
- **SHAP Values Computation**: Calculated SHAP values for each feature across all training samples, yielding a matrix \( \text{SHAP} \in \mathbb{R}^{1488 \times 21} \). Each value represents a feature’s contribution to the model’s output for a given sample.
- **Feature Importance Ranking**: Computed mean absolute SHAP values per feature:
  \[
  \text{Importance}_j = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\text{SHAP}_{i,j}|, \quad j = 1, \ldots, 21
  \]
  where \( N = 1488 \). This ranks features by their average impact on predictions.
- **Results**: Top features included `abnormal_short_term_variability` (highest SHAP), `histogram_variance`, and `prolongued_decelerations`, aligning with clinical knowledge of FHR variability and decelerations as key distress indicators [11]. Low-ranking features (e.g., `fetal_movement`, `histogram_min`, `severe_decelerations`) had mean SHAP values near zero, indicating minimal predictive power.

#### 3.2.4 Feature Selection
- **Thresholding**: Selected the bottom 11 features with the lowest mean SHAP values for removal, reducing dimensionality by approximately 50%. Dropped features:
  - `fetal_movement`
  - `histogram_width`
  - `histogram_max`
  - `mean_value_of_long_term_variability`
  - `histogram_number_of_peaks`
  - `light_decelerations`
  - `histogram_tendency`
  - `histogram_number_of_zeroes`
  - `severe_decelerations`
  - `baseline value`
  - `histogram_min`
- **Rationale**: These features contributed negligibly to LightGBM’s predictions (e.g., `fetal_movement` SHAP < 0.01), likely due to noise, redundancy with retained features (e.g., `baseline value` vs. `histogram_mean`), or low clinical relevance in this context [11]. Retaining 10 features balances model complexity and predictive power.
- **Output**: Updated dataset \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10} \), with `fetal_health` as the target.

#### 3.2.5 Validation
Re-trained LightGBM on the reduced feature set, achieving 92.8% accuracy—a negligible drop from 93%—confirming that dropped features were dispensable. This step, completed in `"SHAP_LightGBM.ipynb"`, informed the subsequent pipeline in `"Final_Model.ipynb"`.

#### 3.2.6 Contribution
SHAP-driven feature selection is a novel contribution, replacing ad-hoc pruning [3] with an interpretable, data-driven approach. It enhances downstream model efficiency and focuses on clinically actionable predictors, setting the stage for our temporal framework.

### 3.3 Temporal Data Simulation

#### 3.3.1 Motivation
CTG data is inherently temporal, reflecting FHR and contraction changes over time, yet the dataset provides static summaries. Static models [1, 2] overlook this dynamic, limiting their ability to capture sequential patterns. We simulated pseudo-temporal data to address this gap, implemented in `"Final_Model.ipynb"`.

#### 3.3.2 Preprocessing
- **Scaling**: Applied `MinMaxScaler` to the reduced 10-feature dataset (\( X \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 10} \)), ensuring values in [0, 1] for consistency with CTGAN and TabNet.
- **Data Structure**: Converted scaled data to a DataFrame (`X_scaled`) with original column names (e.g., `abnormal_short_term_variability`).

#### 3.3.3 Simulation Process
- **Time Steps**: Defined \( n_{\text{time_steps}} = 5 \), reflecting a plausible sequence length for CTG monitoring (e.g., 5-minute intervals).
- **Noise Addition**: For each sample \( x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{10} \):
  - Generated 5 noisy versions:
    \[
    x_{i,t} = \text{clip}(x_i + \epsilon_t, 0, 1), \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, 4
    \]
    where \( \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{U}(-0.05, 0.05)^{10} \) is uniform noise.
  - Clipping ensured values remained in [0, 1], preserving scaling.
- **Implementation**: Used a nested loop:
  ```python
  n_time_steps = 5
  X_temporal = []
  y_temporal = []
  for i in range(len(X_scaled)):
      sample = X_scaled.iloc[i].values
      time_series = []
      for t in range(n_time_steps):
          noise = np.random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05, size=sample.shape)
          noisy_sample = np.clip(sample + noise, 0, 1)
          time_series.append(noisy_sample)
      X_temporal.append(time_series)
      y_temporal.append(y.iloc[i])
  X_temporal = np.array(X_temporal)  # Shape: (2126, 5, 10)
  y_temporal = np.array(y_temporal)
  ```
- **Output**: \( X_{\text{temporal}} \in \mathbb{R}^{2126 \times 5 \times 10} \), \( y_{\text{temporal}} \in \{1, 2, 3\}^{2126} \).

#### 3.3.4 Rationale
- **Noise Level**: ±5% mimics typical FHR variability (e.g., 5–10 bpm fluctuations [11]), introducing plausible temporal variation without distorting clinical patterns.
- **Five Steps**: Balances computational feasibility and temporal granularity, simulating short-term dynamics observable in CTG traces.
- **Novelty**: Unlike static augmentation (e.g., SMOTE [4]), this preserves feature correlations across time, enhancing realism.

#### 3.3.5 Validation
Visual inspection of simulated samples confirmed that noise preserved feature distributions (e.g., mean `abnormal_short_term_variability` stable), supporting its suitability for downstream modeling.

---

### 3.4 Synthetic Data Generation with Dual CTGANs

#### 3.4.1 Motivation
The dataset’s imbalance (77.8% Normal vs. 8.3% Pathological) biases models toward the majority class, reducing sensitivity to critical Pathological cases [1]. Traditional oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) generates static, noisy samples, lacking temporal coherence. We employed dual CTGANs to synthesize realistic temporal samples for minority classes.

#### 3.4.2 Preprocessing
- **Minority Filtering**: Extracted Suspect and Pathological samples:
  ```python
  minority_mask = np.isin(y_temporal, [2, 3])
  X_minority_temporal = X_temporal[minority_mask]  # Shape: (471, 5, 10)
  y_minority_temporal = y_temporal[minority_mask]  # Shape: (471,)
  ```
- **Flattening**: Reshaped to \( X_{\text{minority_flat}} \in \mathbb{R}^{471 \times 50} \) for CTGAN compatibility:
  ```python
  X_minority_flat = X_minority_temporal.reshape(len(X_minority_temporal), -1)
  feature_names = [f'f{t}_{col}' for t in range(n_time_steps) for col in X.columns]
  data_minority_flat = pd.DataFrame(X_minority_flat, columns=feature_names)
  data_minority_flat['fetal_health'] = y_minority_temporal
  ```
- **Sample Adjustment**: Trimmed to a multiple of 10 (470 samples) for batch processing.

#### 3.4.3 CTGAN Training
- **Class Separation**: Split into Suspect (294 samples) and Pathological (176 samples) subsets.
- **Model Setup**: Initialized two CTGAN instances:
  ```python
  ctgan_suspect = CTGAN(epochs=500, batch_size=50, verbose=True, cuda=True)
  ctgan_pathological = CTGAN(epochs=500, batch_size=50, verbose=True, cuda=True)
  ```
  - **Parameters**: 500 epochs ensured convergence, batch size 50 balanced memory and speed, `cuda=True` leveraged GPU acceleration.
- **Training**: Fit each model on its respective subset, specifying `fetal_health` as a discrete column.
- **Sample Generation**: Calculated target sizes to balance classes (~1,655 each):
  - Suspect: \( 1655 - 295 = 1360 \)
  - Pathological: \( 1655 - 176 = 1479 \)
  ```python
  synthetic_suspect = ctgan_suspect.sample(n_suspect)
  synthetic_pathological = ctgan_pathological.sample(n_pathological)
  ```

#### 3.4.4 Data Integration
- **Concatenation**: Combined synthetic samples:
  ```python
  synthetic_data = pd.concat([synthetic_suspect, synthetic_pathological], ignore_index=True)
  synthetic_flat = synthetic_data.drop('fetal_health', axis=1).values
  synthetic_labels = synthetic_data['fetal_health'].values
  ```
- **Reshaping**: Restored temporal structure:
  ```python
  X_synthetic_temporal = synthetic_flat.reshape(-1, n_time_steps, X_scaled.shape[1])  # Shape: (2839, 5, 10)
  X_gan_temporal = np.vstack([X_temporal, X_synthetic_temporal])  # Shape: (4965, 5, 10)
  y_gan_temporal = np.hstack([y_temporal, synthetic_labels])  # Shape: (4965,)
  ```

#### 3.4.5 Rationale
- **Dual CTGANs**: Separate models per class preserve distinct distributions (e.g., Pathological’s higher variability), unlike single oversampling methods [4, 7].
- **Temporal Preservation**: Flattening and reshaping maintain time-step correlations, surpassing static synthesis.
- **Balance**: Achieving ~1,655 samples per class eliminates bias, enhancing minority class detection.

#### 3.4.6 Validation
Synthetic samples’ feature distributions (e.g., `histogram_variance`) closely matched originals (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, \( p > 0.05 \)), confirming realism.

### 3.5 Uncertainty-Aware TabNet with Permutation Regularization

#### 3.5.1 Model Definition
We extended `TabNetClassifier` [2] in `"Final_Model.ipynb"`:
```python
class UncertaintyTabNet(TabNetClassifier):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.3).to(device)
        self.training = True
        self.device = device

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.tensor(x, dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)
        if self.training or self.dropout.training:
            x = self.dropout(x)
        return self.network(x)

    def predict_proba(self, X):
        self.network.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            X_tensor = torch.tensor(X, dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)
            probs = []
            for _ in range(50):
                self.network.train()
                logits, _ = self.forward(X_tensor)
                prob = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1).cpu().numpy()
                probs.append(prob)
            probs = np.stack(probs, axis=0)
        return np.mean(probs, axis=0), np.std(probs, axis=0)
```
- **Architecture**: Input dimension 50 (5 × 10 flattened), output 3 classes, `sparsemax` mask for attention.
- **Dropout**: Added 30% dropout before the network for uncertainty.
- **Uncertainty**: 50 Monte Carlo passes with dropout enabled, computing mean \( \mu(X) \) and standard deviation \( \sigma(X) \).

#### 3.5.2 Permutation Regularization
- **Function**: Defined `augment_data` to permute features in 10% of samples:
  ```python
  def augment_data(X, y, permutation_prob=0.1):
      X_augmented = []
      y_augmented = []
      for sample, label in zip(X, y):
          if np.random.rand() < permutation_prob:
              perm = np.random.permutation(sample.shape[0])
              sample = sample[perm]
          X_augmented.append(sample)
          y_augmented.append(label)
      return np.array(X_augmented), np.array(y_augmented)
  ```
- **Purpose**: Enhances robustness by varying feature order, leveraging TabNet’s attention to adapt.

#### 3.5.3 Data Preparation
- **Splitting**: Stratified split into 70% train (3,475), 30% test (1,490), with 20% of train as validation (695).
- **Flattening**: Reshaped \( X_{\text{train}} \), \( X_{\text{valid}} \), \( X_{\text{test}} \) to \( \mathbb{R}^{\text{samples} \times 50} \).

#### 3.5.4 Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Optuna Setup**: Defined an objective function:
  ```python
  def objective(trial: Trial):
      n_d = trial.suggest_int('n_d', 32, 128)
      n_a = trial.suggest_int('n_a', 32, 128)
      n_steps = trial.suggest_int('n_steps', 3, 10)
      gamma = trial.suggest_float('gamma', 1.0, 2.0)
      lambda_sparse = trial.suggest_float('lambda_sparse', 1e-4, 1e-2, log=True)
      learning_rate = trial.suggest_float('learning_rate', 1e-3, 1e-1, log=True)
      batch_size = trial.suggest_categorical('batch_size', [128, 256, 512])
      tabnet = UncertaintyTabNet(
          input_dim=n_time_steps * X_scaled.shape[1], output_dim=3,
          n_d=n_d, n_a=n_a, n_steps=n_steps, gamma=gamma,
          lambda_sparse=lambda_sparse, optimizer_fn=torch.optim.Adam,
          optimizer_params=dict(lr=learning_rate), mask_type='sparsemax', verbose=0
      )
      tabnet.fit(X_train_flat, y_train_final, eval_set=[(X_valid_flat, y_valid)], max_epochs=100, patience=20, batch_size=batch_size)
      y_pred = np.argmax(tabnet.predict_proba(X_valid_flat)[0], axis=1) + 1
      return accuracy_score(y_valid, y_pred)
  ```
- **Execution**: Ran 50 trials with `optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')`, optimizing validation accuracy.

#### 3.5.5 Training
- **Instantiation**: Initialized `perm_reg_tabnet` with best parameters (e.g., `n_d=64`, `batch_size=256`).
- **Augmentation**: Applied `augment_data` to \( X_{\text{train_flat}} \).
- **Fit**: Trained with:
  ```python
  perm_reg_tabnet.fit(
      X_train=X_train_augmented, y_train=y_train_augmented,
      eval_set=[(X_valid_flat, y_valid)], eval_name=['valid'],
      eval_metric=['accuracy'], max_epochs=100, patience=20,
      batch_size=study.best_params['batch_size'], virtual_batch_size=128
  )
  ```

#### 3.5.6 Evaluation
- **Prediction**: Computed \( \mu(X_{\text{test}}) \) and \( \sigma(X_{\text{test}}) \) using `predict_proba`.
- **Metrics**: Derived predictions as \( y_{\text{pred}} = \arg\max(\mu(X)) + 1 \), calculated accuracy, F1-scores, and mean uncertainty.

#### 3.5.7 Rationale
- **Uncertainty**: Adds clinical trust, absent in [1, 2].
- **Permutation**: Reduces overfitting, novel for TabNet.
- **Tuning**: Ensures optimal performance, surpassing manual settings.

---

### 3.6 Implementation Details
- **Environment**: Python 3.11, Google Colab with NVIDIA GPU (e.g., Tesla T4).
- **Libraries**: `pytorch-tabnet` (v4.1), `ctgan` (v0.7), `optuna` (v3.0), `shap` (v0.45), `lightgbm` (v4.0).
- **Seeds**: Set `torch.manual_seed(42)` and `np.random.seed(42)` for reproducibility.
