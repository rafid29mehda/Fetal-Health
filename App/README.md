Developing a risk scoring system involves integrating your model’s predictions into an interpretable framework suitable for clinicians. Below is a detailed plan for creating a clinically deployable risk scoring system:

---

### **1. Objectives of the Risk Scoring System**
- Provide clinicians with an interpretable, actionable score that quantifies the risk of fetal health conditions.
- Prioritize transparency and explainability to facilitate trust and adoption.
- Ensure real-time decision-making capability for integration into clinical workflows.

---

### **2. Framework for the Risk Scoring System**
#### **Input**
- Clinical features from the cardiotocography test (preprocessed and scaled).
  
#### **Output**
- A **risk score** on a scale (e.g., 0–100) with thresholds for:
  - **Low Risk (0–40)**: Likely Normal.\n  
  - **Moderate Risk (41–70)**: Likely Suspect, recommend additional observation.\n  
  - **High Risk (71–100)**: Likely Pathological, recommend immediate action.\n  

#### **Core Components**
1. **Model Prediction**:
   - Use the optimized TabNet model to predict the probability for each class (Normal, Suspect, Pathological).
2. **Score Calculation**:
   - Convert predicted probabilities into a weighted risk score.
   - Example formula:  
     \[
     \text{Risk Score} = P_{\text{Suspect}} \times 50 + P_{\text{Pathological}} \times 100
     \]
3. **Explainability**:
   - Use SHAP values to highlight the top contributing features for each prediction.
4. **Thresholds**:
   - Define clinically validated thresholds for actionable risk categories.

---

### **3. Implementation Steps**
#### **Step 1: Model Integration**
- Export the trained TabNet model using a framework like `joblib` or `torch.save` for deployment.\n  
- Ensure input preprocessing (e.g., scaling) is included in the deployment pipeline.

```python
import joblib
from pytorch_tabnet.tab_model import TabNetClassifier

# Save the TabNet model
tabnet_model.save_model('tabnet_model.zip')

# Load the model for inference
loaded_model = TabNetClassifier()
loaded_model.load_model('tabnet_model.zip')
```

#### **Step 2: Risk Scoring Function**
Develop a scoring function that:
1. Takes preprocessed features as input.
2. Generates class probabilities using the TabNet model.
3. Computes a risk score based on the formula above.

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_risk_score(features, model):
    """
    Compute risk score based on model predictions.
    
    Parameters:
    - features: Preprocessed input features (array or DataFrame).
    - model: Trained TabNet model.
    
    Returns:
    - risk_score: Calculated risk score (0–100).
    - class_probs: Predicted probabilities for each class.
    """
    # Predict probabilities
    class_probs = model.predict_proba(features)
    # Risk score calculation
    risk_score = class_probs[0][1] * 50 + class_probs[0][2] * 100
    return risk_score, class_probs
```

#### **Step 3: Threshold Calibration**
- Use the validation dataset to define thresholds for risk categories.\n  
- Example:  
  - Low Risk: \([0, 40]\)\n  
  - Moderate Risk: \([41, 70]\)\n  
  - High Risk: \([71, 100]\)\n  

```python
def categorize_risk(risk_score):
    if risk_score <= 40:
        return "Low Risk"
    elif risk_score <= 70:
        return "Moderate Risk"
    else:
        return "High Risk"
```

#### **Step 4: Explainability with SHAP**
Use SHAP to explain predictions for each case by identifying the most impactful features driving the risk score.

```python
import shap

# Initialize SHAP explainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(loaded_model)

def explain_prediction(features):
    """
    Generate SHAP explanations for a given input.
    
    Parameters:
    - features: Preprocessed input features (array or DataFrame).
    
    Returns:
    - shap_values: SHAP values for the prediction.
    """
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(features)
    return shap_values
```

#### **Step 5: Deployment Interface**
- Develop an interface for clinicians to input patient data and receive:\n  
  - **Risk Score**\n  
  - **Risk Category**\n  
  - **Feature Contributions** (via SHAP explanations).\n  

Example using a lightweight web application framework like Streamlit:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Streamlit app for risk scoring
st.title("Fetal Health Risk Scoring System")

# User input
st.header("Enter Clinical Data:")
# Create input fields dynamically for all features
inputs = {feature: st.number_input(f"{feature}", step=0.1) for feature in X.columns}

# Convert inputs to DataFrame for model compatibility
input_data = pd.DataFrame([inputs])

# Predict and display results
if st.button("Calculate Risk"):
    risk_score, class_probs = compute_risk_score(input_data, loaded_model)
    risk_category = categorize_risk(risk_score)
    st.subheader(f"Risk Score: {risk_score:.2f}")
    st.subheader(f"Risk Category: {risk_category}")
    st.write("Class Probabilities:", class_probs)
    shap_values = explain_prediction(input_data)
    st.subheader("Feature Contributions:")
    st.write(shap_values)
```

---

### **4. Validation and Deployment**
#### **Clinical Validation**
- Collaborate with clinicians to validate the system's thresholds and interpretability.\n  
- Conduct retrospective testing on unseen clinical datasets.

#### **Deployment**
- Deploy the model as an API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.\n  
- Integrate with hospital information systems (HIS) for seamless data exchange.

### **5. Benefits of the Risk Scoring System**
1. **Actionable Insights**: Provides clear risk categories for timely clinical decisions.\n  
2. **Explainability**: Highlights key features influencing predictions, fostering trust.\n  
3. **Scalability**: Designed for integration with real-time systems.\n  
4. **Improved Outcomes**: Prioritizes high-risk cases for immediate attention.\n  

This system represents a significant step toward translating advanced AI models into practical clinical tools.
